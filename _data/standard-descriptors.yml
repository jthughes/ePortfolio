  descriptor: "2.4 Understand and respect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to promote reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians."
  indicator: "Demonstrate broad knowledge of, understanding of and respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories, cultures and languages"
  reflection: "Promoting respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders people, their histories, culture, and language, and promoting reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians is undeniably important, but when the damage of the absence of respect and reconcilliation is not present daily, it can be easy to forget about its impact. Respect and reconcilliation is hard when everyone is not aware of the issues tied up in them, and if they are not talked about in school, it can be easy for that knowledge to be missed by entire classes of students, which only works to maintain current biases and disrespect. So, it is important to make sure are aware of the Indigenous cultures and histories, and are aware of the importance of reconcilliation and respect. While this content can be addressed directly in various classes, even just the steady reinforcement that there is value to these cultures and histories, and that there is a continuing need for reconcilliation can affect students and produce outcomes. [REVIEW]"
  evidence: "Evidence of promoting reconciliation can be seen in the Indigenous Content Unit Plan, particularly the investigation."

  descriptor: "2.6 Information and Communication Technology (ICT)."
  indicator: "Implement teaching strategies for using ICT to expand curriculum learning opportunities for students."
  reflection: "Use of ICT can be of significant benefit to student learning, though the manner in which it can depends heavily on the availability of technology inside and outside of the classroom. For example, using a learning management system (LMS), or a service such as OneNote to digitally organise online any notes and resources produced by the teacher, providing access to class content to students even if they were unable to attend a given lesson. I have used a tablet with stylus input while connected to a project to present notes and content instead of using a projector, which has allowed students to use personal devices in class to review notes from earlier in the class or from previous lessons, as necessary, without the need to keep all notes visible on the board at once. Interactive online quizzes using platforms like Kahoot provide opportunity to quickly review content in a fun way that all students can participate in. Use of video, or even the possibility of video conferencing, can provide the opportunity to involve professionals in relevant fields to contribute directly to the classroom without needing to step into the room."
  evidence: "Evidence of using ICT to expand learning opportunities for students can be seen in the organised OneNote Class Notebooks providing access to notes and other resources for students, through the revision Kahoot quizes created, and the inclusion of resources such as videos in unit plans."


# Standard 3: Plan for and implement effective teaching and learning
- id: "apst3-1"
  descriptor: "3.1 Establish challenging learning goals."
  indicator: "Set learning goals that provide achievable challenges for students of varying abilities and characteristics."
  reflection: "What is challenging for a student varies significantly between students. Even when students are organised into streamed classes based on ability, there will usually be significant variation of ability between students on any given topic. Because of this, learning goals need to be flexible enough to provide challenge across this variation."

  descriptor: "3.7 Engage parents/carers in the educative process."
  indicator: "Describe a broad range of strategies for involving parents/carers in the educative process."
  reflection: "There a different ways in which parents and carers can be involved in the educative process. One area in particular can be in providing support to students in subjects in which they are struggling. Communication with parents/carers could create an opportunity to share strategies or resources for support the child in learning the subject, whether in the classroom or at home. Related is in managing student workloads and ensuring the relevant assignment work is completed. For example, a work avoidance strategy sometimes used by students can be to tell teachers that work has been left at home, and then go home and tell parents/carers that no work has been set, or that it has been left at school. Left to go on, then no progress is made on student work or learning. This only strategy only works for the student if there is no communication between teachers and parents/carers. By keeping parents/carers informed, teachers and parents/carers can work together to support or approriately pressue students to support learning. Parents/carers can also be a good source of external expertice that can be be brought into the class to give different perspectives on content."

# Standard 4: Create and maintain supportive and safe learning environments
- id: "apst4-1"
  descriptor: "4.1 Support student participation."
  indicator: "Identify strategies to support inclusive student participation and engagement in classroom activities."
  reflection: "There can be a number of barriers to student participation, and thus engagmenet, in classroom activities. Asking closed questions with only one correct answer, and taking the first hand up discourages the less confident, and reinforces that idea that you have to be quick to be good at maths. Instead, preference should be given to open questions with multiple correct answers, though these take more planning to be truely effective. Choosing a student to answer questions entirely at random can be effective for a class with uniform ability to ensure all students have to be paying attention and engaged with the class. A better option for classes with mixed ability is to have opportunities for discussions with a neighbour, or a table group. This encourages all students to talk and get involved. If you take the opportunity to walk around and listen to student thinking at the same time, you can potentially support specific students to share their useful and unique thoughts with the class. A strategy making use of ICT is use of a survey platform, or something like a Desmos activity, to provide all students an opportunity to anonymously submit a response, allowing you to share ideas without needing to focus attention on a single student if they don't want the spotlight."
  evidence: "Evidence of this can been seen in the choice of year 7 maths enrichment activities, bingo game"

- id: "apst4-2"
  descriptor: "4.2 Manage classroom activities."
  indicator: "Demonstrate the capacity to organise classroom activities and provide clear directions."
  reflection: "Organisation and clarity are key aspects of effectively managing classroom activities. If there is a task or activity to perform, and the instructions on what to do, how to do it, and when to do it are all clear, then there's a good chance it will go smoothly. Of course, if the classroom activity has not been properly planned and organised in advance, giving adequate instuctions clearly will be basically impoosible. If there is an absence of these two aspects, its usually very clear to see in the behaviour of the class. So, to achieve that organisation and clarity, you need to make sure that any materials are preppared and can be quickly and efficiently distributed so that there is not significant downtime for students recieving materials first/last. This might require having another activity on the go first that gives you time to distribute resources first before transitioning activities. But for this to work, the instructions need to be clear and concise, so that all students can quickly understand what is going on, and what they should be doing at any given point. Consistency in the manner that instructions are given can go a long way to supporting this, whether that is colour coding instructions on the board to indicate what to do with each task, or always the days work found in a specific place so they know they can always find what to do next. An important aspect of delivery instructions is also to present the instructions in multiple forms, and repeat the instructions. So verbally go through the instructions, but also list the instructions on the board. If there are resources being handed out, then list instructions there too, and if it looks or sounds like there are students that have missed the prior instructions, remind the class of the instructions and that the instructions can be found in the normal place on the board/room, etc."
  evidence: "Evidence can be seen in instructions for bingo game lesson plan, and photographs of boardwork, and OneNote task setting."

- id: "apst4-3"
  descriptor: "4.3 Manage challenging behaviour."
  indicator: "Demonstrate knowledge of practical approaches to manage challenging behaviour."
  reflection: "There are many ways that challenging behaviour can be exhibited, for a variety of different causes. While ideally strategies are implemented to prevent the behaviour arising in the first instance, the reality is that sometimes it will be unavoidable, and so having practical ways of managing such behaviour already ready to go is valuable. One strategy is certainly to be aware of the schools behaviour management policy to know and be able to enforce in a consistent manner the appropriate consequences. But turning to research and to the advice of other experienced educators is valuable, which was what was involved in writing a personal handbook on 'Promoting a Positive Learning Environment'. Clearly established rules, that might be displayed around the room, which are consistently enforced can be effective. Use of Glasser's Triplets ("What are you doing? Is it against the rules? What should you be doing?") is a similar tactic, though relies on clear task setting with a visual component that can be referenced. Ideally less confrontational methods are used first, but increase the confrontation as is necessary to resolve the severity of the disruption, to the extent of providing students the choice to obey or accept the logical punishment for the infraction, making use of the school behaviour manegment systems if necessary, or the behaviour continues consistently."
  evidence: "Evidence can be been seen in the Handbook for Promoting a Positive Learning environment, and in practicum reports."

  descriptor: "4.5 Use ICT safely, responsibly and ethically."
  indicator: "Demonstrate an understanding of the relevant issues and the strategies available to support the safe, responsible and ethical use of ICT in learning and teaching."
  reflection: "While ICT can be used to great effect, it is also easily misused and students can easily be on either side of an improper use of ICT. One part of misusing ICT is in the form of plagiarism. While students can be guilty of plagiarism without using any technology, the reality is that the internet is often the first (and sometimes only) port of call for students when doing research. Without having been trained to properly reference, or even being aware that there is a problem with not referencing can make it very easy for students to unknowingly plagiarise. It is then important to educate students both on how to properly give attribution to any sources they make use of, but also show them the real world consequences when you don't. Another way that ICT get misused is cyberbulling. Using technology, whether phone messages/calls, email, or social media, bullies can continue to bully other children outside of the schoolyard, at any hour of the day. This is an area particularly where it is incredibly valuable for students to know what their options are when they are being bullied online, and for the bullies, what the consequences are of being caught."
  evidence: "Evidence can be seen in the Cyber-safety professional learning session attended, and in the information given about properly referencing research in the JSMEP competition student task sheet."


# Standard 5: Assess, provide feedback and report on student learning
- id: "apst5-1"
  descriptor: "5.1 Assess student learning."

- id: "apst5-3"
  descriptor: "5.3 Make consistent and comparable judgements."
  indicator: "Demonstrate understanding of assessment moderation and its application to support consistent and comparable judgements of student learning."
  reflection: "Moderation is a very important, and is particularly important as an aspect of SACE assessment. Particarly, as at Stage 2 level, final student results are ranked against student results from across the state, but also the country (for the purpose of the ATAR), it is important that all students have recieved gradings that accurately represent the quality of their submitted work. 
  - Fair grade
  - Favouritism
  - Different assessment pieces

# Standard 6: Engage in professional learning
- id: "apst6-1"
  descriptor: "6.1 Identify and plan professional learning needs."
  indicator: "Demonstrate an understanding of the role of the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers in identifying professional learning needs."
  reflection: "The Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (APSTs) provided a useful framework for teachers to identify their strengths and weaknesses as a teacher. Because care in being thorough has been taken in creating the standards, and then there is a requirement to engage with and provide evidence of the standards to gain and maintain registration, teachers are regularly expected to reflect on which standards have been given more attention to, and which standards need more attention. For pre-service teachers, they provide a good overview of the different aspects of teaching to try and engage with as much as possible while on placement, or in any other preparation for becoming a registered teacher. Having an awareness of which standards I had a need to learn about meant that when another educator talked about the Stronger Smarter online professional learning program, I was able immediately identify that as a specific source of professional learning to undertake to improve my practice as a teacher."
  evidence: ""

- id: "apst6-2"
  descriptor: "6.2 Engage in professional learning and improve practice."
  indicator: "Understand the relevant and appropriate sources of professional learning for teachers."
  reflection: "While reading a random webpages may offer suggestions that might end up leading to an improvement in your teaching at some point, it is hardly a reliable way of receiving relevant and appropriate professional learning. Good places to start are professional learning recommened or required by the Department for Education, or any other learning that is required for registration. Officially recognised training organisations become the best place to receive these types of training. Another place to find quality professional learning is through professional teaching associations. These associations organise or advertise professional learning opportunities to best support teachers that are part of the association. Often these organisation put on annual conferences that not only provide opportunity for proffessional learning through workshops and keynotes, but also provide great opportunities to network with other professionals. Schools will also often provide internal opportunities for professional development of staff that has been selected to support staff in meeting school objectives. Another source of professional learning is through properly researched, referenced, and reviewed, research papers and books on topics relevant to educations."
  evidence: "Evidence can be seen in the different forms of professional learning that I have engaged in: mandated training, voluntary attendance of externally organised sessions, and internal school professional learning. "

- id: "apst6-3"
  descriptor: "6.3 Engage with colleagues and improve practice."
  indicator: "Seek and apply constructive feedback from supervisors and teachers to improve teaching practices."
  reflection: "Other teachers, particularly those with more experience than you, are great resources for improving your practice, but only if you talk to them, and actually trial any offered advice in your classroom. I was particuraly conscious of that as a pre-service teacher on teaching practicums. A nice thing about teaching practicum is the presence of a more experienced teacher in every lesson, who is able to offer rapid feedback on what went well, what needed improvement, and how to fix it, whether that's immediately after a lesson, or in a free moment during the lesson. Particularly in the earliest lessons I taught, it was incredibly valuable to be able to immediately try the mentor's suggestions in the next class, and see immediate improvements in the class. The continual access to the mentor was also useful in the planning process to ensure the reasonableness of unit and lesson plans."
  evidence: "Evidence of seeking feedback is found particularly in the final report of each placement."

- id: "apst6-4"
  descriptor: "6.4 Apply professional learning and improve student learning."
  indicator: "Demonstrate an understanding of the rationale for continued professional learning and the implications for improved student learning."
  reflection: "Fundamentally, continued professional learning supports teachers in improving their practice, and if teachers are imiproving the quality of their teaching effectively and appropriately, then this should provide opportunities for improved student learning. This doesn't just mean that the teacher might undertake learning to improve how they present a particular topic, but encompasses training to identify and support students struggling with mental health, or any other type of learning that allows teachers to support students through challenges from outside of the classroom, so that when they are inside the classroom they are in a better position to actually learn."

  reflection: "Working with parents and carers is an important aspect of working in a school environment, and the manner in which that is done is important. Parents/carers are usually investing in the learning and wellbeing of their children, and when there are concerns about either, are often in a position to provide support from home, provided they are kept in the loop.

  descriptor: "7.4 Engage with professional teaching networks and broader communities."
  indicator: "Understand the role of external professionals and community representatives in broadening teachers’ professional knowledge and practice."
  reflection: "Teaching isn't, or shouldn't, be a solitary profession, and a teacher isn't a master of everything, and does not have the time to be. As a teacher, the challenges you face are not always going to be so unique to you that no one else has ever faced a similar challenge. And so by enganging with other educators, and with members of other communities, you can bring into the classroom new strategies and additional knowledge that you as a sole teacher may never have otherwise discovered. I have made great use of Twitter to benefit my teaching. By connecting with maths educators from around the world, I have gained access to many useful resources, from which I have drawn activities, lesson ideas, and even teaching pedagogies. It has also lead to some great suggestions for professional readings to improve my practice, as well as support when I have asked for it.
