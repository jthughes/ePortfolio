# Standard 1: Know students and how they learn
- id: "apst1-1"
  descriptor: "1.1 Physical, social and intellectual development and characteristics of students."
  indicator: "Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of physical, social and intellectual development and characteristics of students and how these may affect learning."
  reflection: "Students are constantly growing and developing, whether physically, socially, or intellectually, and these changes often present new challenges for students, and thus their teachers. Take for example answering a question in class. A student who is shy is going to find that quite challenging, and so the teacher should approach doing so carefully. But take for example a male student who's voice is changing to become lower. Having your voice crack in front of the class can be quite embarassing, and so that may effect a student's willingness to contribute to the class by answering questions. But so also could the social dynamics of a group of students, if bullying or exclusion is going on. The bullied/excluded student is not going want to contribute to the class in front of those doing the bullying. Each of these scenarios, while having the same outcome, could be caused by different developments or characteristics, and have different ways of being supported. <br><br> Another way these types of characteristics can be seen in the classroom is the effect of the seating arrangements of students. A students position in the room, and students that they are seated with can have significant effects on student learning. Students who are short-sighted, but have not had their eyes tested to get glasses, who sit at the back of the class with their friends are going to be unable to properly read instructions on the board, which will likely lead to disengagement. Having the student instead sit near the front might allow them to see better, and actually be able to get involved in learning. The same idea applies for students with impaired hearing. Positioning them in the room in a way that maximises their ability to hear instructions is going improve their ability to learn. The social dynamic of student groups can also be important. Some students react poorly to each other, or will misbehave together, so making sure that they are separated in classes will help to improve their ability to learn, but also help to remove general distractions from the rest of the class. Managing this could be done by just directing individual students to sit in certain areas, modifying the layout of the room to help beneficial seating arrangements to form naturally, or could even be going to the extent of creating a specific seating plan for the whole class, thereby not singling out individual students."
  evidence: "Evidence of this can be seen in the layout of classrooms, and the creation of specific seating plans for classes while on placement."

  descriptor: "1.2 Understand how students learn."
  indicator: "Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of research into how students learn and the implications for teaching."
  reflection: "It is important to understand how students learn, so that you don't just blindly 'teach', hoping that students learn. Or similarly, it's important to know the different ways in which students learn, because teaching to the manner in which you learnt may work for some students, but certainly won't work for all students. Research into classroom management has some overlap, as classroom management involves removing barriers to learning, and particularly preventative action is focused on engaging students in learning, so by necessity requires an understanding of how students learn. For example, Rudolf Dreikur’s Goal Centered Theory has the idea that students misbehave when their needs are unmet. A need might be a need to belong, so teaching that makes students feel as though the belong, whether that's through positive encouragement, or through being able to make meaningful contributions in group work, is both working to resolve behavioural problems, but also supporting the student to be in the right headspace to learn. <br><br>
  Gardner's Multiple Intelligences suggest that people are intelligent in more ways than just being good at mathematics. These different intelligences align well with different ways of interacting with content. A student with strong interpersonal skills is going to be more successful when they can use those skills to learn through group work and discussion, while a student with strong spacial intelligence is going to appreciate visual aids and manipulables, connecting connecting new concepts to their physical understandings. Implementing these ideas in a class can be as simple as providing instructions in multiple ways, but some more interesting examples were the use of both physical and digital 3D models to demonstrate hard to visualise problems when dealing with surface areas of solids."
  evidence: "Evidence of this can be seen in the 3D objects prepared for a year 10 maths class to aid their visual understanding, but also in the sythensis of the relevant research in the Handbook for Promoting a Positive Learning Environment. "

  descriptor: "1.3 Students with diverse linguistic, cultural, religious and socioeconomic backgrounds."
  indicator: "Demonstrate knowledge of teaching strategies that are responsive to the learning strengths and needs of students from diverse linguistic, cultural, religious and socioeconomic backgrounds."
  reflection: "While teachers should always be conscious of their biases, and their assumptions of what they can expect students to know or be able to do, that awareness is critical for teaching students with diverse backgrounds. Students from different countries and/or languages are going to struggle with language or analogies unique to the local area, and while that doesn't mean that you shouldn't ever use them, it does mean that you should ensure you explain them. When you have students from varying socioeconomic backgrounds, use of technology needs to be carefully considered. If a BYOD policy is in effect, but a student's family is not in a position to supply a device, then the use of technology in the classroom needs to be modified to not disadvantage those students, whether that's only using devices when the activity requires sharing, or by booking a space where the students have the option of using school provided equipment. Another angle is that of internet access. If a student doesn't have access to the internet at home, whether that's an issue of socioeconomics or otherwise, activities that require the student to regularly use the internet at home cannot be used, and for example, research assignments should either allow for physicals sources, or sufficient time to complete the task should be provided in class. An example of responding to cultural and religious backgrounds is through awareness of students keeping Ramadan. Particularly for lessons held towards the end of the school day, care should be taken to not disadavantage students who have not eaten recess or lunch as part of their fast."

  descriptor: "1.4 Strategies for teaching Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students."
  indicator: "Demonstrate broad knowledge and understanding of the impact of culture, cultural identity and linguistic background on the education of students from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander backgrounds."
  reflection: "When the culture, cultural identity, and language of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are not talked about and valued, they can often be forgotten and the impact of these on students of those backgrounds overlooked. But also, Australian culture has certain stereotypes that they often assign, consciously or otherwise, to those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background, that says they will think and act in certain ways, and will never be any good academically. When teachers take on these biases, children will pick up on them, and then the ideas of low self worth are reinforced, molding students into stereotypes and becoming a self fulling prophecy. It is important for teachers to show, and really to prove to the students, that they are valued, and so is the culture from which they come from. The Stronger Smarter idea of being 'Deadly and Smart' is an idea of being unashed of your culture, and to make the most of the potential that everyone has. While students can be told of that idea, it's up to the teacher to really make sure that students believe it, and part of that is consciously avoiding the biases of the general public, and having high expectations of all students, regardless of background and culture."

  descriptor: "1.5 Differentiate teaching to meet the specific learning needs of students across the full range of abilities."
  indicator: "Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of strategies for differentiating teaching to meet the specific learning needs of students across the full range of abilities."
  reflection: "In the classroom setting, even if you have streamed classes, it is unlikely that all students in a class are going to have the same level of ability, something that increases the challenge of keeping all students engaged and learning at the same time. Sometimes differentiation might just take the form of presenting the same information in different manners, for example, explaining a concept verbally, writing it on a whiteboard, and providing a visual demonstration. As students can connect with different types of presentation more than others, using multiple supports all students, and the reinforcement of the mixture of methods is not wasted either. <br><br>Differentiation also has other forms. Work or activities that is achievable for all students, but provide extension work, additional challenges, or the opportunity for bonus marks, for students who are quicker or more capable. Questions that start easy but steadily increase in difficulty again allow for all students to achieve progress, while allowing some students to progress further while still engaging with the same task. Generally, open questions and open-ended tasks work well - open questions allow for multiple correct answers to allow all students to contribute to the shared knowledge, and open-ended tasks allow students to work, learn, and meaningfully contribute at the level they are at.

  descriptor: "1.6 Strategies to support full participation of students with disability."
  indicator: "Demonstrate broad knowledge and understanding of legislative requirements and teaching strategies that support participation and learning of students with disability."
  reflection: "Students with disability have the same right to enrol and participate in learning as a student without, and there is a requirement of schools and teachers to ensure that students with a disability have access to the same opportunities as other students. How to support a student with disability depends on the nature of the disability. For example, a student with a disability that affects their mobility can be supported by modifying classroom layouts and providing appropriate access to the school facilities, whereas supporting students with learning disabilities is going to be supported in other ways. In some cases, providing access to school services officers (SSOs) to support students in the classroom may be necessary, or providing assistance to students with dyslexia by allowing the option to have text read to them, or working with them to use coloured paper for printouts to support the students in reading and writing unaided."

# Standard 2: Know the content and how to teach it
- id: "apst2-1"
  descriptor: "2.1 Content and teaching strategies of the teaching area."
  indicator: "Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the concepts, substance and structure of the content and teaching strategies of the teaching area."
  reflection: "Studying at university developes conceptual understanding of content, but just knowing the content isn't sufficient to teaching it. Being able to take that understanding, and break it down in a manner that can be effectively conveyed to students is it's own skill. An important part of learning is being able connect new ideas to existing knowledge, or in some instances, being able take new knowledge and rebuild your existing knowledge to make the new knowledge fit. Faciliating that is part of the challenge of the teacher. Providing opportunities for investigation and discussions does a number of things - it frees the teacher from making a best guess of what knowledge the entire class doesn't have, instead allowing students to focus on what they need, at the level they are at, with the teacher able to listen and offer specific guidance as necessary. In Mathematics, the idea of Notice and Wonder activities helps facilitate this. It prompts students to think, and offer suggestions in a space where there are few wrong answers and many correct ones. With a little bit of guidance from the teacher and their peers, each student is encouraged to discover something new, making the relevant series of connections with guidance when necessary. In Physics, many of the concepts are seen in action daily, or at least can be linked with those physical understandings from personal experience. As students instictively understand some physical phenomena, making use of that knowledge can be extremely valuable in teaching the content, though equally, when incorrect understanding has been learnt, care must be taken to fix such misunderstandings."

  descriptor: "2.2 Content selection and organisation."
  indicator: "Organise content into an effective learning and teaching sequence."
  reflection: "It is important to consider the most natural progression of concepts when developing learning and teaching sequences. Student need conceptual understanding before they can put their understanding in to practice, and some concepts rely on others, or at least are made simpler if other knowledge already exists. For example, learning how to multiply numbers is made easier by understanding how to count and add numbers first. By identifying the core ideas that a particular section of content relies on, and building out the sequence from there, allows the teacher assemble the sequence without skipping important context to new ideas and concepts. A great way of doing this is by creating a concept map which shows how all the concepts in the topic link together."
  evidence: "Evidence of this can be seen in the concept map of a Stage 2 Physics subtopic, along with the unit plans developed from SACE outlines."

- id: "apst2-3"
  descriptor: "2.3 Curriculum, assessment and reporting."
  indicator: "Use curriculum, assessment and reporting knowledge to design learning sequences and lesson plans."
  reflection: "Sources of currciculum, such as ACARA or SACE, provide definitions of all of the content that should be covered in a year of teaching. That these are sorted and grouped into topics assists with adapting learning sequences from them. Using the listed outcomes, you understand the extents of what needs to be taught, and then you break it down into a sequence of topics that should be taught in order - a concept map can help with this. Once you have the flow of which content should be addressed first, you need to decide on a starting point - this can be estimated based on what students should have achieved previously, with initially lessons able to be more review of old concepts, and introducing the basics of some of the new ideas. Once you're actually teaching the lessons though, doing some early assessment or pre-testing to double check the level that students are at can help to fine tune the starting point. From there, the rest of the sequence can be built out with lesson plans, using the concept map to structure the order. It is important to ensure that early assessment is included throughout the sequence to provide opportunity to overcome any difficulties before summative assessment occurs. Also factored in is the external deadlines for getting assessments done, such as keeping in sync with other classes, if that is required, or being prepared for end of term reports, etc. "

  descriptor: "2.4 Understand and respect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to promote reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians."
  indicator: "Demonstrate broad knowledge of, understanding of and respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories, cultures and languages"
  reflection: "Promoting respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders people, their histories, culture, and language, and promoting reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians is undeniably important, but when the damage of the absence of respect and reconciliation  is not present daily, it can be easy to forget about its impact. Respect and reconciliation  is hard when everyone is not aware of the issues tied up in them, and if they are not talked about in school, it can be easy for that knowledge to be missed by entire classes of students, which only works to maintain current biases and disrespect. So, it is important to make sure are aware of the Indigenous cultures and histories, and are aware of the importance of reconciliation  and respect. While this content can be addressed directly in various classes, even just the steady reinforcement that there is value to these cultures and histories, and that there is a continuing need for reconciliation  can affect students and produce outcomes. [REVIEW]"
  evidence: "Evidence of promoting reconciliation can be seen in the Indigenous Content Unit Plan, particularly the investigation."

  descriptor: "2.5 Literacy and numeracy strategies."
  indicator: "Know and understand literacy and numeracy teaching strategies and their application in teaching areas."
  reflection: "The ability to teach literacy and numeracy skills is important at all stages of school. You might have students recently from a different countries whose English literacy is not at the same level as the rest of the class, and so taking care to use strategies like associating new unknown words with words they already understanding can help support the students in the classroom. But these strategies are generally useful regardless. In Mathematics, many new concepts come with unusual names and so all students benefit from a process of defining words through associations with existing ideas (for example, 'circumference' is the perimeter of a circle), continue to reinforce the connection between the words for a period of time, before starting to just use the proper terminology without providing the associated idea alongside. As for numeracy strategies, while there is value to avoid writing unnecessary information that students should be able to infer, when students have missed learning concepts, or not fully connected their knowledge, missing out the extra information leads to more confusion. So sometimes showing the invisible zero ('+ 0'), the invisible one ('1a'), or the invisible multiplication ('3x(3+1)'), turn something that could have been a source of confusion into a moment of immediate understanding by just taking a few extra seconds."

  descriptor: "2.6 Information and Communication Technology (ICT)."
  indicator: "Implement teaching strategies for using ICT to expand curriculum learning opportunities for students."
  reflection: "Use of ICT can be of significant benefit to student learning, though the manner in which it can depends heavily on the availability of technology inside and outside of the classroom. For example, using a learning management system (LMS), or a service such as OneNote to digitally organise online any notes and resources produced by the teacher, providing access to class content to students even if they were unable to attend a given lesson. I have used a tablet with stylus input while connected to a project to present notes and content instead of using a projector, which has allowed students to use personal devices in class to review notes from earlier in the class or from previous lessons, as necessary, without the need to keep all notes visible on the board at once. Interactive online quizzes using platforms like Kahoot provide opportunity to quickly review content in a fun way that all students can participate in. Use of video, or even the possibility of video conferencing, can provide the opportunity to involve professionals in relevant fields to contribute directly to the classroom without needing to step into the room."
  evidence: "Evidence of using ICT to expand learning opportunities for students can be seen in the organised OneNote Class Notebooks providing access to notes and other resources for students, through the revision Kahoot quizzes created, and the inclusion of resources such as videos in unit plans."


# Standard 3: Plan for and implement effective teaching and learning
- id: "apst3-1"
  descriptor: "3.1 Establish challenging learning goals."
  indicator: "Set learning goals that provide achievable challenges for students of varying abilities and characteristics."
  reflection: "What is challenging for a student varies significantly between students. Even when students are organised into streamed classes based on ability, there will usually be significant variation of ability between students on any given topic. Because of this, learning goals need to be flexible enough to provide challenge across this variation. A method that maths textbooks often use is to have a set of questions that are at the intended level of the class, with then have a few questions that extend the knowledge at the end of the section, to provide extra challenge to the students able to complete the earlier questions. This idea can be reused in many different contexts, whether it's an activity with three different dificulty levels that students can choose between, or something else. When undertaking investigations, if the subject of investigation is flexible, students are able to engage with the content to the level of their ability."

  descriptor: "3.2 Plan, structure and sequence learning programs."
  indicator: "Plan lesson sequences using knowledge of student learning, content and effective teaching strategies."
  reflection: "Once you have gained familiarity with a student cohort, it becomes easier to plan subsequent learning sequences to capabilities and interests of the students in that particular class. That might be teaching a small topic entirely through games, or another topic with one large investigation that provides learning opportunities for all the concepts that need to be covered. A particular group could find a lot more value in visual aids than the previous group for instance. But planning based on knowledge of student learning can also be more immediate. If some mid-topic assessment highlights an area that students are all struggling with, the teacher will need to resquence lessons to provide additional support in that area, while still achieving the other objectives."
  evidence: ""

- id: "apst3-3"
  descriptor: "3.3 Use teaching strategies."
  indicator: "Include a range of teaching strategies."
  reflection: "While students learn in different ways, and so varying methods of teaching helps to support the full range of students, use of different teaching strategies is beneficial to all students. For example, one of the High Impact Teaching Strategies is Multiple Exposures, the idea of interacting with the concepts in different forms, with space between exposures for students to have time to make sense of one exposure first, before rounding out their knowledge with other exposures. It's also seen in providing variation between parts of a single lesson, or between different lessons. In practice, this could be making using of direct instruction, class discussions, and demonstrations that involve students to convey the ideas of a concept in the period of a lesson, and at regular intervals throughout a unit, run quizes to help drill concepts that students have been working with. Another angle is using a mixture of direct instruction followed by practice, and activities that include games or investigations that facillitate learning in a different manner."
  evidence: "Evidence of a range of teaching strategies can be seen in different types of lessons I have run, including direct instruction, quick quizes, learning activities, and games."

- id: "apst3-4"
  descriptor: "3.4 Select and use resources."
  indicator: "Demonstrate knowledge of a range of resources, including ICT, that engage students in their learning."
  reflection: "Twitter has been an amazing source of maths educational resources, introducing me to new styles of activities to engage students. A great example is that of the 'Which One Doesn't Belong' activity, which offers students four different things to compare and asks them to identify features that three of the objects share that the fourth doesn't. The best versions of the activity have multiple ways that each shape is unique, allowing for a lot discussion and analysis, and providing an opportunity for students to discover interesting features of a particular mathematical idea. ICT in the classroom also creates some unique opportunties for engaging students in their learning. Services like Quizlet or Kahoot make for quick and engaging activities, whether purely a fun entirely competative quiz, or a group collaboration activity. Technology also provides opportunity for effective visualisations, whether that's demostrating the features of graphs using Desmos, or showing a 3D model that can be manipulated to view it a different angles. "
  evidence: "Evidence of this standard can be seen in the variety of engaging resources used in classes, such a variation of bingo, kahoot quizes, visual activities, and puzzles."

- id: "apst3-5"
  descriptor: "3.5 Use effective classroom communication."
  indicator: "Demonstrate a range of verbal and non-verbal communication strategies to support student engagement."
  reflection: "While the teacher's voice is one of their most useful tools, it is not the only one. An important part of engaging students in learning is clear task setting, is something that can benefit from verbal instructions being supported by written instructions that are easy to find and follow, and if necessary, direct modelling of the task to be undertaken by students. A mixture of strategies can also be used in managing class behaviour, where sometimes just the teachers presence near a students table is sufficient to encourage students back on task without the teacher needing to verbally prompt students. Something that can also affect student engagment is the manner in which the teacher presents themselves. If a teacher is visibly and audibly interested, and happy to be there, it can rub off on students and encourage them to engage in the lesson too. The reverse is definitely true - a teacher who sounds bored, or looks anxious or uncertain is going to convey the ideas that what they have to say is uninteresting, or that they don't know what they're doing, both of which are much more likely to produce disengagement."
  evidence: "Evidence of understanding the range of strategies availible can be seen in the Handbook on Promoting a Positive Learning Environment, and in examples of clear written instructions (i.e. non-verbal communication)."

- id: "apst3-6"
  descriptor: "3.6 Evaluate and improve teaching programs."
  indicator: "Demonstrate broad knowledge of strategies that can be used to evaluate teaching programs to improve student learning."
  reflection: "Once a unit of content has been taught, there is an opportunity to review the unit to improve it for future reuse. As lesson sequences get reworked during the teaching of the unit, by reflecting on it at the end, the teacher can modify the original plan to better sequence lessons to minimize the need to reorganise lessons through out, short of external interuptions. Another good aspect to evaluate is the quality of the assessment pieces - was extra clarification needed in task sheets? Did test questions have application problems that made assumptions of student knoweldge that were unfounded? Moreso than content, how were the activities recieved? Sometimes the same activity will work really well with one group but fall flat with another, and by considering the reasons why one worked and one different will both help with reusing the activity in future, but also in designing activies for later lessons with the same class."

  descriptor: "3.7 Engage parents/carers in the educative process."
  indicator: "Describe a broad range of strategies for involving parents/carers in the educative process."
  reflection: "There a different ways in which parents and carers can be involved in the educative process. One area in particular can be in providing support to students in subjects in which they are struggling. Communication with parents/carers could create an opportunity to share strategies or resources for support the child in learning the subject, whether in the classroom or at home. Related is in managing student workloads and ensuring the relevant assignment work is completed. For example, a work avoidance strategy sometimes used by students can be to tell teachers that work has been left at home, and then go home and tell parents/carers that no work has been set, or that it has been left at school. Left to go on, then no progress is made on student work or learning. This only strategy only works for the student if there is no communication between teachers and parents/carers. By keeping parents/carers informed, teachers and parents/carers can work together to support or appropriately pressure students to support learning. Parents/carers can also be a good source of external expertise that can be brought into the class to give different perspectives on content."

# Standard 4: Create and maintain supportive and safe learning environments
- id: "apst4-1"
  descriptor: "4.1 Support student participation."
  indicator: "Identify strategies to support inclusive student participation and engagement in classroom activities."
  reflection: "There can be a number of barriers to student participation, and thus engagement, in classroom activities. Asking closed questions with only one correct answer and taking the first hand up discourages the less confident, and reinforces that idea that you have to be quick to be good at maths. Instead, preference should be given to open questions with multiple correct answers, though these take more planning to be truly effective. Choosing a student to answer questions entirely at random can be effective for a class with uniform ability to ensure all students have to be paying attention and engaged with the class. A better option for classes with mixed ability is to have opportunities for discussions with a neighbour, or a table group. This encourages all students to talk and get involved. If you take the opportunity to walk around and listen to student thinking at the same time, you can potentially support specific students to share their useful and unique thoughts with the class. A strategy making use of ICT is use of a survey platform, or something like a Desmos activity, to provide all students an opportunity to anonymously submit a response, allowing you to share ideas without needing to focus attention on a single student if they don't want the spotlight."
  evidence: "Evidence of this can been seen in the choice of year 7 maths enrichment activities, and in bingo game activity run for a year 8 maths class"

- id: "apst4-2"
  descriptor: "4.2 Manage classroom activities."
  indicator: "Demonstrate the capacity to organise classroom activities and provide clear directions."
  reflection: "Organisation and clarity are key aspects of effectively managing classroom activities. If there is a task or activity to perform, and the instructions on what to do, how to do it, and when to do it are all clear, then there's a good chance it will go smoothly. Of course, if the classroom activity has not been properly planned and organised in advance, giving adequate instructions clearly will be basically impossible. If there is an absence of these two aspects, its usually very clear to see in the behaviour of the class.<br><br> So, to achieve that organisation and clarity, you need to make sure that any materials are prepared and can be quickly and efficiently distributed so that there is not significant downtime for students receiving materials first/last. This might require having another activity on the go first that gives you time to distribute resources first before transitioning activities. But for this to work, the instructions need to be clear and concise, so that all students can quickly understand what is going on, and what they should be doing at any given point. Consistency in the manner that instructions are given can go a long way to supporting this, whether that is colour coding instructions on the board to indicate what to do with each task, or always the days work found in a specific place so they know they can always find what to do next. An important aspect of delivery instructions is also to present the instructions in multiple forms, and repeat the instructions. So verbally go through the instructions, but also list the instructions on the board. If there are resources being handed out, then list instructions there too, and if it looks or sounds like there are students that have missed the prior instructions, remind the class of the instructions and that the instructions can be found in the normal place on the board/room, etc."

  descriptor: "4.3 Manage challenging behaviour."
  indicator: "Demonstrate knowledge of practical approaches to manage challenging behaviour."
  reflection: "There are many ways that challenging behaviour can be exhibited, for a variety of different causes. While ideally strategies are implemented to prevent the behaviour arising in the first instance, the reality is that sometimes it will be unavoidable, and so having practical ways of managing such behaviour already ready to go is valuable. One strategy is certainly to be aware of the schools behaviour management policy to know and be able to enforce in a consistent manner the appropriate consequences. But turning to research and to the advice of other experienced educators is valuable, which was what was involved in writing a personal handbook on 'Promoting a Positive Learning Environment'. Clearly established rules, that might be displayed around the room, which are consistently enforced can be effective. Use of Glasser's Triplets ('What are you doing? Is it against the rules? What should you be doing?') is a similar tactic, though relies on clear task setting with a visual component that can be referenced. Ideally less confrontational methods are used first, but increase the confrontation as is necessary to resolve the severity of the disruption, to the extent of providing students the choice to obey or accept the logical punishment for the infraction, making use of the school behaviour management systems if necessary, or the behaviour continues consistently."

  descriptor: "4.4 Maintain student safety."
  indicator: "Describe strategies that support students’ well-being and safety working within school and/or system, curriculum and legislative requirements."
  reflection: "There are different ways in which students can be safe, each with different strategies to support students. Cyber safety is an example. Use of the internet or other forms of ICT are fraught with many different types of dangers, where providing knowledge and training on identifying dangers are and what can be done to escape bad situations helps to support students in that area. On the other side of the spectrum, there is the physical safety of students, which can involve proper drilling of emergency procedures for evacuations or invacuations at school, or in performing adequate risk assessments for sports activities, science practicals, excursions, or any other similar thing. Following and enforcing school guidelines like hats in high UV, or no students outside when temperatures are high support student well-being and safety. In case of emergencies, being properly trained to perform first aid. Keeping aware of any necessary mandatory reporting to be done. Further training such as the Keep Safe: Child Protection Curriculum (KS:CPC) training, or Mental Health First Aid training. Through proper training, following school procedures, and through constant vigilance, the teacher is able to continually support all students in remaining safe, and in looking after their wellbeing."

  descriptor: "4.5 Use ICT safely, responsibly and ethically."
  indicator: "Demonstrate an understanding of the relevant issues and the strategies available to support the safe, responsible and ethical use of ICT in learning and teaching."
  reflection: "While ICT can be used to great effect, it is also easily misused and students can easily be on either side of an improper use of ICT. One part of misusing ICT is in the form of plagiarism. While students can be guilty of plagiarism without using any technology, the reality is that the internet is often the first (and sometimes only) port of call for students when doing research. Without having been trained to properly reference, or even being aware that there is a problem with not referencing can make it very easy for students to unknowingly plagiarise. It is then important to educate students both on how to properly give attribution to any sources they make use of, but also show them the real-world consequences when you don't. Another way that ICT get misused is cyberbullying. Using technology, whether phone messages/calls, email, or social media, bullies can continue to bully other children outside of the schoolyard, at any hour of the day. This is an area particularly where it is incredibly valuable for students to know what their options are when they are being bullied online, and for the bullies, what the consequences are of being caught."

  descriptor: "5.1 Assess student learning."
  indicator: "Demonstrate understanding of assessment strategies, including informal and formal, diagnostic, formative and summative approaches to assess student learning."
  reflection: "There are many different ways of assessing student knowledge, and differing uses for assessment. Summative assessment is used as the final representation of a students ability in a particlar area, and is usually is the grade that gets reported on. And while these snapshots are useful for the teacher, they are significantly less so for the student. Formative and diagnostic assessment is much more useful to both the teacher and the student. Diagnostic assessment could be informal questions at the start of a question, or a formal, but brief, written test at the start of a topic, but the assessment is low stakes, and is purely informational - it gives the student an idea of the what the topic will be about, and it allows the teacher to discover if they need to adjust their plans for the topic to address any missing background knowledge. Formative testing, while often still assigned a grade, doesn't necessarily affect report card grades, and is intended as a progress check. It informs the student about how they are doing with the content, gives an idea of what the final assessment will look like, while also informing the teacher of any areas of that need to be retaught or focused on in revision, as well as providing an opportunity for the teacher to provide students with specific feedback.

  descriptor: "5.2 Provide feedback to students on their learning."
  indicator: "Demonstrate an understanding of the purpose of providing timely and appropriate feedback to students about their learning."
  reflection: "Assessment can have different purposes, and one purpose is to give students feedback on their learning. Through their responses to well designed assessment, teachers can identify areas where student could improve, and by giving feedback, whether written or otherwise, can help to give focused support on the areas that the student needs the most assistance with. But for this to be effective, the feedback needs to come while it is still relevant. If a student sits a practice test, which the teacher marks and writes feedback on, but does not hand back the practice test until after the summative test, then short of end of semester exams, the feedback is of little value to the student. They no longer really have an opportunity to fix their mistakes and practice correct methods of work. Equally, marking a test, but only writing a grade on the top with no indication of what was done wrong is not useful feedback. While there are different ways of providing feedback, in general there should be some indication of where the student went wrong or support on how to fix repeated errors. "
  evidence: "Evidence that feedback to students was provided in a timely manner can be seen in placement reports, and appropriate feedback can be seen in samples of assessed student work."

  descriptor: "5.3 Make consistent and comparable judgements."
  indicator: "Demonstrate understanding of assessment moderation and its application to support consistent and comparable judgements of student learning."
  reflection: "Moderation is a very important and is particularly important as an aspect of SACE assessment. Particularly, as at Stage 2 level, final student results are ranked against student results from across the state, but also the country (for the purpose of the ATAR), it is important that all students have received gradings that accurately represent the quality of their submitted work. 
  - Fair grade
  - Favouritism
  - Different assessment pieces
  - Different markers
  - Clear evidence that it should be a different grade
  "
  evidence: "Evidence of knowledge of and ability to moderate assessment can be seen particularly in the Senior Mathematics moderation report assessment piece."

- id: "apst5-4"
  descriptor: "5.4 Interpret student data."
  indicator: "Demonstrate the capacity to interpret student assessment data to evaluate student learning and modify teaching practice."
  reflection: "No one learns exactly the same way, and everyone comes with different knowledge and connections. While one method of teaching might have worked for one lesson, or one class, won't mean that the same lessons will be effective for a different class. But if a different way of teaching is going to be necessary, this needs to be discovered and acted upon early, not at the end of year when nothing more can be done about it. Early assessment of student learning then becomes important in identifying concerns, and in allowing you to react to improve student learning before later more important assessments. While overall grades give overall progress indicators, they don't tell the full story, and so details are important. Did many students struggle on questions that should have been achievable? Did individual students have a particular type of mistake that was repeated throughout the assessment? Did multiple students repeatedly make that same type of mistake? Finding that multiple students 'move' parts of equations to different sides rather than use the inverse operation to cancel it out means that you need to reinforce that part of solving equations. For one class, that meant playing a version of Bingo that practiced that specific skill. But this was only possible by first undertaking early assessment, and then taking the time to analyse the results to guide subsequent lessons."

  descriptor: "5.5 Report on student achievement."
  indicator: "Demonstrate understanding of a range of strategies for reporting to students and parents/carers and the purpose of keeping accurate and reliable records of student achievement."
  reflection: "It is important to keep records of student learning and achievement for a number of reasons. By tracking it, it allows the teacher to identify concerns early and adjust their teaching to support particular students. It allows them to notice any changes in performance that might be due to otherwise undetectable challenges that a child might be going through. It allows the teacher to show that they did have an impact on the student learning, by ideally results trending upwards across the year. There are also often different stages of reporting on student achievement. Often the first stage is giving students results written on submitted work, though it's not always possible to hand back the assessment. Then, if a Learning Management System (LMS) is in use, grades and/or feedback are often posted online. For parents/carers, results can often only be directly reported through end of term reports. However this is far from ideal, and they should really be made aware of results much earlier, particularly in the case of their child struggling with their learning. Not to say that parents/carers should only be contacted when their children are doing poorly - really, it's important to let them know when their child is performing well also. But the question then becomes, 'how?' While phone calls or emails certainly are possible, the extra bookkeeping is not ideal. One solution is to use notes in diaries. Often in high school, students are provided with a diary to keep track of any events or assessment, to help keep themselves organised. Along with this, the school will also usually monitor the diaries to ensure that parents/carers have seen the diary during the week by getting the diaries signed by the parents/carers weekly. With such a system, results of assessment can be put into student diaries when results are handed back, thus enabling parents/carers to see the results. Another option is the use of a LMS. If results are uploaded for the student to access online, often parents/carers can also be given access to their child's information, both as far as keeping up to date with what work the child has to do, but also their results."
  evidence: "Evidence of keeping accurate and reliable records of student achievement can be seen in the mark book of student results and reporting of results can be seen in photographs of test grades in student diaries."


# Standard 6: Engage in professional learning
- id: "apst6-1"
  descriptor: "6.1 Identify and plan professional learning needs."
  indicator: "Demonstrate an understanding of the role of the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers in identifying professional learning needs."
  reflection: "The Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (APSTs) provided a useful framework for teachers to identify their strengths and weaknesses as a teacher. Because care in being thorough has been taken in creating the standards, and then there is a requirement to engage with and provide evidence of the standards to gain and maintain registration, teachers are regularly expected to reflect on which standards have been given more attention to, and which standards need more attention. For pre-service teachers, they provide a good overview of the different aspects of teaching to try and engage with as much as possible while on placement, or in any other preparation for becoming a registered teacher. Having an awareness of which standards I had a need to learn about meant that when another educator talked about the Stronger Smarter online professional learning program, I was able immediately identify that as a specific source of professional learning to undertake to improve my practice as a teacher."

  descriptor: "6.2 Engage in professional learning and improve practice."
  indicator: "Understand the relevant and appropriate sources of professional learning for teachers."
  reflection: "While reading random webpages may offer suggestions that might end up leading to an improvement in your teaching at some point, it is hardly a reliable way of receiving relevant and appropriate professional learning. Good places to start are professional learning recommended or required by the Department for Education, or any other learning that is required for registration. Officially recognised training organisations become the best place to receive these types of training. Another place to find quality professional learning is through professional teaching associations. These associations organise or advertise professional learning opportunities to best support teachers that are part of the association. Often these organisations put on annual conferences that not only provide opportunity for professional learning through workshops and keynotes, but also provide great opportunities to network with other professionals. Schools will also often provide internal opportunities for professional development of staff that has been selected to support staff in meeting school objectives. Another source of professional learning is through properly researched, referenced, and reviewed, research papers and books on topics relevant to educations."
  evidence: "Evidence can be seen in the different forms of professional learning that I have engaged in: mandated training, voluntary attendance of externally organised sessions, and internal school professional learning. "

- id: "apst6-3"
  descriptor: "6.3 Engage with colleagues and improve practice."
  indicator: "Seek and apply constructive feedback from supervisors and teachers to improve teaching practices."
  reflection: "Other teachers, particularly those with more experience than you, are great resources for improving your practice, but only if you talk to them, and actually trial any offered advice in your classroom. I was particularly conscious of that as a pre-service teacher on teaching practicums. A nice thing about teaching practicum is the presence of a more experienced teacher in every lesson, who can offer rapid feedback on what went well, what needed improvement, and how to fix it, whether that's immediately after a lesson, or in a free moment during the lesson. Particularly in the earliest lessons I taught, it was incredibly valuable to be able to immediately try the mentor's suggestions in the next class and see immediate improvements in the class. The continual access to the mentor was also useful in the planning process to ensure the reasonableness of unit and lesson plans."
  evidence: "Evidence of seeking feedback is found particularly in the final report of each placement."

- id: "apst6-4"
  descriptor: "6.4 Apply professional learning and improve student learning."
  indicator: "Demonstrate an understanding of the rationale for continued professional learning and the implications for improved student learning."
  reflection: "Fundamentally, continued professional learning supports teachers in improving their practice, and if teachers are improving the quality of their teaching effectively and appropriately, then this should provide opportunities for improved student learning. This doesn't just mean that the teacher might undertake learning to improve how they present a particular topic, but encompasses training to identify and support students struggling with mental health, or any other type of learning that allows teachers to support students through challenges from outside of the classroom, so that when they are inside the classroom they are in a better position to actually learn."

# Standard 7: Engage professionally with colleagues, parents/carers and the community
- id: "apst7-1"
  descriptor: "7.1 Meet professional ethics and responsibilities."
  indicator: "Understand and apply the key principles described in codes of ethics and conduct for the teaching profession."
  reflection: "Key values that the Teachers Registration Board of South Australia identify in their Code of Ethics are Integrity, Respect, and Responsibility. Expanding on those concepts, integrity is important as teacher are major role models as the people who interact and care for children the most after the child's own parents/carers. We must be honest and trustworthy in our dealings with students, parents, and the wider community. We have a responsibility to provide a high-quality education for our students to support them to become the best version of themselves, and we support this by continually learning more to improve our practice, to maintain a high standard. Finally, we respect learners no matter their background or circumstances, providing the same care and support to all, and showing students that they are valuable and are valued."

  descriptor: "7.2 Comply with legislative, administrative and organisational requirements."
  indicator: "Understand the relevant legislative, administrative and organisational policies and processes required for teachers according to school stage."
  reflection: "There are many different policies and processes that teachers are required to adhere, from the process of attaining and maintaining registration through teaching experience, continued professional learning, and producing evidence of meeting these standards, to the requirements of teaching SACE courses, to the procedures to follow as part of meeting school-based objectives. To focus on SACE, the teacher must be prepared with Learning Assessment Plans from the start of the year, administer the correct number and forms of assessments, such as SATs and folio tasks, adhering to the appropriate guidelines for those assessments. The assessments must be graded based on the appropriate rubrics in a consistent manner. Submission dates for results and moderation need to be met so that student results can go through the moderation process and either confirmed or modified."

  descriptor: "7.3 Engage with the parents/carers."
  indicator: "Understand strategies for working effectively, sensitively and confidentially with parents/carers"
  reflection: "Working with parents and carers is an important aspect of working in a school environment, and the manner in which that is done is important. Parents/carers are usually investing in the learning and wellbeing of their children, and when there are concerns about either, are often in a position to provide support from home, provided they are kept in the loop.

  descriptor: "7.4 Engage with professional teaching networks and broader communities."
  indicator: "Understand the role of external professionals and community representatives in broadening teachers’ professional knowledge and practice."
  reflection: "Teaching isn't, or shouldn't, be a solitary profession, and a teacher isn't a master of everything, and does not have the time to be. As a teacher, the challenges you face are not always going to be so unique to you that no one else has ever faced a similar challenge. And so, by engaging with other educators, and with members of other communities, you can bring into the classroom new strategies and additional knowledge that you as a sole teacher may never have otherwise discovered. I have made great use of Twitter to benefit my teaching. By connecting with maths educators from around the world, I have gained access to many useful resources, from which I have drawn activities, lesson ideas, and even teaching pedagogies. It has also led to some great suggestions for professional readings to improve my practice, as well as support when I have asked for it. I've also been able to attend teacher conferences that I was made aware of through twitter. The Mathematics Association of South Australia (MASA) had their annual conference which I was able to attend after finding out about it on Twitter. Better yet, I was able to make use of the connections I had made, as well as some of the resources I had gathered while at the conference to run interesting activities and improve my lessons. Finally, though I am still new to the profession, I have been able to make valuable contributions to other educators through Twitter, whether through offering suggestions to teachers about to mentor pre-service teachers for the first time, by contributing an article to virtual conference, or by compiling and sharing a puzzle resource for other teachers to use."
  evidence: "Evidence can be seen in my Twitter account, through my blog, and through specific tweets about my contributions."
