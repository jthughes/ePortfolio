It has become a lot more important that a teacher takes care to what and how they assess. It is becoming more important to encourage the development of, and thus assess, student skills like problem solving or creative thinking, rather than just the ability to write facts they've heard on a piece of paper. It results in more care being required in how tasks are set, in communicating expectations to the students about the assessment, and providing opportunity for students to demonstrate those skills. A skill like creative thinking can be hard to teach - teaching a student how to think can be the opposite of what's necessary - it teaches them a specific way of thinking, which removes all space for creative thought.

Thus it lends itself towards guiding students, making the most of their existing creativity and ability, and providing guidance for more self-driven learning, ensuring that two things are achieved: the curriculum is learnt by the student, and the student has learnt, or practiced, being a self-driven learner who is able to think for themselves, which is a skill that can carry them further beyond the influence of their teacher and a school.
