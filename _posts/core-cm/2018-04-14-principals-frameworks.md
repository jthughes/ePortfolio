I decide to become a teacher because I had a list of traits I thought that good teacher had. I felt I possessed half that list, and that the rest were all traits I wanted to develop. The ones that I would identify with currently are as follows:
* Teachers need to care about their students learning, and show it.
* They need to love helping people to learn.
* They need to be aware of their need to continue to learn more, to become a better teacher
* They need to know their content well.

Looking at the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (APST), I would already associate with the following standards:

**1 - Know students and how they learn**

**1.2 Understand how students learn** - From my experiences from assisting peers, tutoring students, helping friends and family, and working with children in contexts like Outside School Hours Care (OSHC) or Sunday School, and from my studies, I have an appreciation of how people can learn in a wide variety of different ways, and that preparation must be made to assist in managing that.

**1.3 Students with diverse linguistic, cultural, religious, and socioeconomic backgrounds** - Through schools, or friends, I've interacted with a range of people from particularly diverse religious and socioeconomic backgrounds, to have some level of understanding about the needs of some of those groups.

**2 - Know the content and how to teach it**

**2.1 Content and teaching strategies of the teaching area** - The areas I have chosen to pursue teaching are the areas that have intrinsically interested me since a young age, which has driven my studies into those areas. Having continued those studies through a university degree, that gives me the general content knowledge that can then be directed through the curriculum.

**2.6 Information and Communication Technology (ICT)** - ICT has been a big part of my life from a child, and has formed part of my hobbies for a long time. I have, and continue to, keep abreast of what new technologies exist, and learn how to use new technologies that are relevant to me, so that I can make use of them in the future. This knowledge and interest is then readily applicable to tackling the problems of supporting student learning.

**4 - Create and maintain supportive and safe learning environments**

**4.5 Use ICT safely, responsibly, and ethically** - my interest and use of technology has helped me to developed an understanding and awareness of the issues involving the safe, responsible, and ethical uses of technology, all of which I care about already, outside of the context of the classroom.

**6 - Engage in professional learning**

**6.2 Engage in professional learning and improve practice** - In addition to my studies, I have sought out experiences to assist in preparation in being a classroom teacher. This has included various jobs including tutoring, OSHC, Sunday School, alongside experiences working on committees for organizing young people gatherings, or attending a Maths Teacher conference, or making use of Twitter to access content shared by teachers from across the world.

Many of the standards, such as Standard 3 (Plan for and implement effective teaching and learning), the first parts of Standard 4 (Create and maintain supportive and safe learning environments), Standard 5 (Assess, provide feedback, and report on student learning), or Standard 7 (Engage professionally with colleagues, parents/carers, and the community) cover areas in which in some cases I may have some relevant skill or knowledge, but largely relate to experiences in schools as a teacher, or skills that are to be developed by the courses been taken this year.
