**Response:** "From your experience of Seminar 1, and reading Chapter 2, what historical features do you see as influencing the current SACE curriculum?"

Across the history of education in Australia there has been a large amount in change in the composition and presentation of curriculum, from an initial state of there being none. But even in the time that there has been set curriculum for schools to teacher there has been change. But for all that, there are still features that can be readily identified as coming from historical roots.

From the time that the schooling system was used as an economic tool to develop young people into better employees for the future, there is still a strong focus on job readiness as part of SACE, through subjects like PLP or courses that directly focus on work related skills, like business classes, or the integration of pathways like VET studies that can be used as a part of SACE learning. SACE equally feeds into the system of preparing students for tertiary studies at universities and other educational institutions, with a focus on written assessment and final year exams at Stage 2 in preparation for university ranking programs, and university study.

It does endeavour to push students to learn beyond just these focuses however, requiring different types of assessments so that students are provided better opportunity to learn and be assessed in ways favourable to individual students.
