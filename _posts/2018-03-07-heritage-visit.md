Reflections:
* [educ.sifnt.net.au] still actually works as of 7 March 2018, but redirects to school Haiku system.
* Currently uses Haiku, may change (investigating Canvas).
* Facebook groups: [SACE Chemistry Teachers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1863695123917258/?ref=br_rs), [SA Physics Teachers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/883944085091512/?ref=br_rs)
* SACE text books: [SASTA](http://www.sasta.asn.au/resources/sace_stage_2_workbooks), [Essentials](https://essentialseducation.com.au/year-level/12/subject/physics/)
* [Education Share Moodle](http://dlb.sa.edu.au/edshmoodle/) - requires a school/professional email, but email [Paul Gavini](mailto:paul.gavini389@schools.sa.edu.au) with subject of "edshmoodle" from said school email.
* Use flipped classroom videos as additional reading/viewing resources on LMS site.
