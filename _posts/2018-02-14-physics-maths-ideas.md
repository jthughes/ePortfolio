Some conversations this week have resulted in some interesting ideas to consider for the future when teaching in the classroom.

I was reminded of some of the things that the [Maths Learning Centre](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/mathslearning/) does - they have a massive (approx 3x3 metre) cartesian plane marked on the floor with masking tape, so that they can physically demonstrate concepts on graphs, which could be an interesting thing to try out in a classroom.

And listening to a conversation my Physics tutor was having with another student, they used the example of the the classrooms roof being a positively charged conductor, and the floor being a negatively charged conductor, allowing them to combine physical objects with gravity to give a large scale physical representation of what a positively charged particle would do inside that type of electric field. This concept made the image of a classroom with streamers hung from the roof as electric field lines as part of that demonstration spring to mind. So now I want to try it at some point.

(As an addendum, writing this made me feel like checking the MLC twitter feed (or strictly, [#100factorial](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100factorial)), when looking at their page, which got me looking at David Butler's [twitter](https://twitter.com/DavidKButlerUoA) (a useful resource), on which I found [this conversation](https://twitter.com/vaslona/status/960297146082762752) about Lowest Common Denominators, and Greatest Common Factors, which I thought was noteworthy. So here I am, noting it down.)
