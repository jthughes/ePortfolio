> If you were sitting in a school staff-room and were asked 'Should we have national and international benchmark testing of Australian students?' what would your response be?

I believe that yes, within reason, there should be national benchmark testing of Australian students. National benchmarking helps to identify state of the education of students from different regions across different regions. However, the testing should be ideally not be intrusive to the classroom. But that is made hard by the process of conducting such tests. For an individual study, it's hard to make a single test that will adequately test the desired skills effectively for every student. That's the benefit of assessment that is taken from across a mixture of assessment methods, over a long period of time, allowing students to demonstrate knowledge more naturally, and in ways that may better suit the individual.

Other issues include things like the following:
* The testing needs to be conducted in a fair and consistent manner across regions, so that the results are meaningful. This becomes harder as the scale increases.
* Benchmarking should prompt study into reasons for difference in performances, with studies prompting policy. This is not always the case.

These two points reduce the value of international benchmarking tests - with different cultures, it becomes increasingly harder to moderate, and keep fair, and harder to follow up with studies in a reasonable manner. And for all these problems, people are even more likely to misapply the results of these tests without understanding the underlying issues and assumptions of the results.

I think overall, provided that testing can be done without intruding too much into student learning, and results are carefully considered, and only acted upon with further study when there do exist statistically significant variations between regions, then (inter)national benchmarking can be valuable. But I'm not sure if any of that is the case.
