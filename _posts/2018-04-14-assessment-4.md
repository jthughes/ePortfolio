**Assessment __*Of*__ Learning**

Exams and other forms of summative assessment. These are typically the point at which student learning of a specific topic is no longer assessed, or given any weight in grading. Used for grading and ranking students.

**Assessment __*For*__ Learning**

This is assessment that the teacher takes for the purpose of informing their teaching. Written formative tests or any other diagnostic that highlights knowledge gaps in individuals or groups become assessment for learning if the teacher makes use of that knowledge to inform how they teach, and they focus on the specific knowledge gaps.

**Assessment __*As*__ Learning**

Assessment as learning can be found in the same formative tests that teachers can use for learning, but it requires student motivation to turn the assessment into learning. By undertaking assessment, whether teacher set or otherwise, students can analyse their own state of learning and then react to the results by focusing their personal learning to fill in any gaps in knowledge.

Vgotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) can play an important role in how to plan for learning, and understanding the results of assessment. Students have an existing body of knowledge. To add to that body of knowledge, the new ideas must be outside of that body of knowledge, but close enough that they can be contextualized by what they already know, and then added to that body, learning the new idea (and usually effectively too). Keeping this in mind while lesson planning helps to maximize the learning being done, but also helps to inform the reason why some students may struggle - students don't all have the same body of knowledge in all areas, which affects their ability to learn new ideas in the same way. Assessment for learning can help the teacher to identify these variations to better target learning for the students.
