An example of a learning experience I've had difficulty mastering in the past is in attempting to learning the Visual Studio workflow for projects at the same time as trying to learn how to use relational databases like SQL for the purposes of putting together more than a very simple phone application. The challenge comes in the large number of interconnected concepts and ideas that need to be mastered fairly simultaneously to produce the application, while most of them lie beyond my direct experience.

I believe the sequence of ideas, however, follows something like this:
* Focus on learning the basics of SQL, following a number of tutorials
* Follow this by learning the basics of technologies like PHP that interface with SQL databases to simplify some of the interactions. Again follow a number of basic tutorials
* Identify a series of projects that can bridge the gap between the concepts used in the PHP and SQL tutorials and the necessary knowledge for the intended mobile application, and follow through these project.
* Having built up my body of knowledge with these new skills and understandings, tackle tutorials for learning the Visual Studio workflow, again beginning with basic tutorials. By having prepared the SQL and PHP knowledge separately, this process should then be smoother.
* From that point, tackle smaller projects first if necessary, but otherwise the required set of knowledge required should now be available in a manner that has allowed for easier learning.

A challenge with this type of undertaking is that it is a large and interesting project that sparks interest in the initial learning, but while initial tutorials are typically fairly trivial, they often also seem irrelevant to the skills needed to complete the larger project. If they're skipped, later tutorials make little sense, but then it can be hard to get the motivation to progress through tutorials in a way to add schema in a logical sequence. Receiving that learning from a course with specific requirements and deadlines can provide that motivation.
