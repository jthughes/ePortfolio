It's the first week back for 2018, earlier than normal for a 4 day intensive course to get us started, and it's been great.

We've had the opportunity to meet and listen to presentations from a number of people, like Bob Buxton from the SACE board to talk about SACE, and issues relating to assessment, or Loretta Bowshall from the Mercedes College to learn a bit about the International Baccalaureate. We've gotten an idea of how the course is going to work, along with placements, from Brendan Bentley and Petra Galbraith, and we've picked up some crowd control tips, among other things, from Brendan.

We've also got introduced to this, an ePortfolio, by Jarrod Johnson to keep track of all the professional content we produce, both for personal use, and for use in gaining employment. Right now, it's bare bones, with the layout copied from the template, with only a few details and a picture added, but it should be fun to get it all running, and filled with information!

It's also been great to meet some of my fellow Maths and Physics Pre-service Teachers before the classes for the Curriculum and Methodology courses start up next week. So far, it's been something like 8/10 people I've talked to are doing Maths or Physics, and half of them are doing both. Among those number are Mark, Josh, Anelle, and Faith.
