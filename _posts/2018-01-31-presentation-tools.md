*An introduction to different presentation tools that move beyond whiteboards for delivering content. Examples include quiz platforms ([Poll Everywhere](http://polleverywhere.com/), [Socrative](http://socrative.com/), [Quizlet](http://quizlet.com/)), and presentation software packages ([Narrated PowerPoint](http://office.com/), [Prezi](http://prezi.com/), [Sway](http://sway.com/)).  A piece of technology called [Swivl](https://www.swivl.com/) was highlighted, being a system for conveniently recording a presentation, while moving around.*

Through school, the bulk of theory classes were delivered in front of a whiteboard. Really, this continued through university - we even still had some maths lectures delivered with chalk on a blackboard. In the later years of school, and through uni, the bulk of content was delivered from in front of projector screen with a PowerPoint. Probably the most interesting method was that of my Senior Physics and Chemistry teacher. Before Microsoft came out with their Surface line, making 2 in 1 devices mainstream, this teacher had a Samsung Slate. And while sometimes he would write notes up on a whiteboard, he would also sometimes use the slate connected to the projector instead. Using it, he could write notes directly onto the tablet screen and have it appear on the projector, giving the experience of writing notes on the whiteboard, (which helped with the timing of how long it for students to take down notes), while not obstructing the view at all. Not only that, but because the this was done digitally, at the end of the lesson, he would have an image file that he could save and upload to the internet for us to refer back to, without having to take time away from the lesson to take a photo of the whiteboard and then clean the board.

It was that teacher who truly inspired me to be a teacher, and I would like to at least try emulate some of the things he did, because I think they worked well. As already discussed, the idea of using a tablet with pen input for writing notes appeals to me for a few reason:
* You don't have the problem of trying to talk while facing the whiteboard.
* Equally, you don't have the problem on not being able to easily monitor the class while writing up notes.
* Writing notes by hand in the class has the benefit of moderating where everyone is up to, and provides a good indication for how long the students will require to copy the notes down (after all, they'll be writing at the same time as you)
* Once you're done, you already have an image file that can be shared with the class online, as a record of what happened in the class, benefiting student revision, and any students who weren't present for that class. The notes in this form become unique through the act of the class participating in the lesson and asking questions or making suggestions.
* [OneNote Class Notebook](https://www.onenote.com/classnotebook) is a technology I've talked about before that I would like to try in the classroom, and [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/) is perfect for using with the digital ink of the pen input.

That's not to say I intend on exclusively using just that method of delivering content. There's definitely a place for whiteboard-style notes in presenting classes, but the technologies discussed in the ICT Integration seminars also make for some great ways of interactively delivering content. The concept of having pre-recorded materials, like narrated PowerPoints, could make for some interesting teaching, if practical in the context of the particular school. Prezi and Sway are neat pieces of software for organising and sharing information in interesting and creative ways. I could see Prezi being interesting to use to have a very general mind map or flow chart of a section of a course, demonstrating the big picture ideas, but then zoom in on the different parts to reveal more detail on each section. Sway seems like a good platform to create a more interactive presentation that students could view on their own devices, in or out of the classroom, allowing you to provide different sections, or additional links to more information about aspects of the presentation in a convenient manner.

The quizzes also seem like a great way of getting immediate feedback of student understanding, provided there is sufficient access to the technologies in the classroom, and each of them are great for different things - Poll Everywhere for quick informative live polls, Socrative for more direct assessment type of quizzes (with an option for some competition), and Quizlet for an interesting way of collaborative learning in groups, while competing with others. An additional quiz platform I have been recently introduced to is [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/). Kahoot has a more directly competitive focus, in a very fun audio-visual way. So you could easily utilise all 4 platforms, depending on the circumstance.
