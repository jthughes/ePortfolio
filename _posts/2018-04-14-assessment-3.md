A non-exhaustive list of types of assessment:
* Tests
* Quizzes
* Reports
* Essays
* Exams
* Performances
* Presentations
* Queries
* Creations

The purpose of an assessment task is important to consider so that you can ensure that the results that you get back provide the information you were after. Not considering whether an assessment adequately meets the intended purpose will make you unaware of problems when the results give different information that what you use them for. And this highlights the necessity of validity, dependability, and reliability in assessment, and the importance of moderation in assessment.

Validity has to do with whether the assessment evaluated what it was intended to. For example, if question is posed in language that makes it hard for the assessed to understand what they are meant to do, or uses language they don't understand, you have ended up testing something different - a students comprehension or language skills. If you were intending on assessing the students mathematical skill, but they weren't able to understand the question, that question was not a valid form of assessment, or at least, the results are not a valid assessment of the student's understanding.

Dependability has more to do with stakeholder (teacher, student, parent) trust in whether the assessment does reflect the student learning, so related by subtly different to whether the test was valid.

Reliability has to do with errors in the measurements taken, so while validity can have an impact on that, it also encompasses the process of turning student submissions into reported measures of learning.

Moderation comes in to make sure that all of these things are happening - that assessment is valid and reliable, and by this process of ensuring validity and reliability, thus helps to increase dependability, by encouraging that trust by removing errors.
