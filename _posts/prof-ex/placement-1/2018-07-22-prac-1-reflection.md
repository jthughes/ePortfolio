So, placement 1. After only a couple days of lead in, it was straight into teaching. I only had two classes initially, year 10 mathematics, and year 11 physics, before taking on year 11 maths in the second week. A particular challenge with the year 11 classes was that they had their midyear exams in the third week, but both classes were running behind, the maths class moreso than the physics class. Without the luxury of time, it forced me to very particular about exactly what I covered, given only one week to both teach 3 or 4 small new concepts *and* provide opportunity to revise concepts for the exam. (APST 2.2) It definitely highlighted the importantance of proper time management across the semester, because it will make it challenging for you, and your students, if you've ended up running behind and not left extra time at the end of the semester. My memories of year 12 were having weeks of in class revision, starting three quarters of the way through term 3, and so I imagine if that's about normal, with that amount of time, there is then plenty of leeway if some topics run long, or get delayed through school events. There seems to be less of that time in year 11 or under however. 

It was interesting to me that by year 10 or 11 maths, some students haven't truly internalised that in algebra $$x$$ is equivalent to $$1x$$. This is important, because when you make use of quadratic factorisation, and your trying to match particular forms, the absence of a visible coefficient results in confusion. Often, students assume that it's zero, not thinking it through to understand that if the coefficient were zero, then $$0x$$ would just be written as $$0$$. While they really should understand that and be comfortable with not seeing the one in front of such variables, I reckon it's more important that worked examples should be as clear as possible, not jumping over details that you should be able to assume that students will be comfortable. Maybe reinforce the fact that you don't need to show it, but let each student decide when they are comfortable with not showing a particular step. (APST 2.1, 2.5)

An early challenge through the first week was the classroom communication, particularly ending the class. I found it hard to keep an eye on the clock while focused on doing my best to get around and support each student individually, which lead to the closing of the lesson being messy as the bell goes and students are just automatically packing up and leaving. This was one of the more immediate pieces of feedback that I got from my mentor on how to manage ending lessons - bringing the class back to attention a few minutes before the bell, having already prepared anything that I needed to tell them. (APST 3.5) I was quickly able to start doing this with much better success after the pointers from the my mentor. (APST 6.3)

The lesson that stood out above the others was the first lesson on permutations with the year 11s. At the start of the last week of placement, we were starting the new topic, but I had two really cool things happen as part of the class, one somewhat planned and the other entirely spontaneous. To discuss permutations, I had planned to talk about countable examples of working out the number of seating arrangements. In class though, rather than just work from the board I decided to instead place 5 chairs in front of the class, and got volunteers to sit in them. So, with 5 empty chairs, how many different options are there for the first person to sit? Once they're seated, how many options for seating the second person? Or from another angle, with 3 seats filled, how many different ways are there arranging the remaining two people? What about if only 2 seats are already filled? The class happily got involved, got a number of them out of their seats, and provided a strong visual representation. The second cool thing to occur was later in the class. Having moved into considering problems on paper to discover properties of factorials for calculating permutations, two students made really insightful observations that I had hoped students would arrive at. I decided then, rather than me just tell the class about the cool thing to instead get one of the students share their cool observation on the board for the benefit of the whole class, which ended up being a great moment. (APST 3.3) 

A big feature of the placement on the whole was getting to engage with the midyear assessment process. I had the opportunity to prepare a practice exam to provide students with an opportunity both to practice the breadth of content that would be covered in the exam, but also to get a feel for how the exam would be presented. Getting to help proof read the actual exam as well was interesting, seeing some of the more specific work that went into it, with particular care taken in how marks were assigned for each question, and how care was taken to make sure questions were actually possible (there was an example of a question which involved a square based pyramid where the numbers as written, while they could be used to find an answer, didn't actually create a physically possible pyramid - the height of the triangles was less than half the length of the base, meaning that the peaks of the triangles couldn't actually meet. Most students would probably apply the relevant formula, but if they were to take a different approach, they would start getting nonsense values. As a result, it was worth changing the numbers to be physical, to make sure everything would be consistent.). (APST 5.1) Getting to mark a lot of the exam papers was interesting, working out how much feedback to provide. On the one hand, it was summative assessment that they wouldn't be able to improve their grade on, but at somepoint in the future, they would need to engage with the content again, whether through investigations, or an end of year exam, or subsequent years. So if they were motivated enough, the feedback could be valuable. In the end, I decided to provide occasional specific feedback, rather than feedback on every single question, as a time management concern - general feedback could be given through an in-class review of the exam paper after the fact. A particular challenge was marking to someone elses marking scheme. While it was great for keeping the marking consistent when students did the same type of working, when there were differences in the way processes were taught between classes, or when the student came up with their own strategy, the simple marking scheme became hard to follow in an attempt to try and make consistent judgements. (APST 5.2)

All in all, it was a great placement. I learnt a lot, and with smaller classes, I was able to focus more on developing my presentation, time management, and communication skills. I feel like a lot of the content we talked about at uni now made a whole lot more sense, having tried things and struggled. In someways, it's a pity you couldn't do this placement first, at the start of the year, and then go to uni and learn how to do it better - I feel like a lot of content would then make a lot more sense, and immediately stick, having experienced the necessity of using what you've learnt.
