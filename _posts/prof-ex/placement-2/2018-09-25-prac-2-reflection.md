Placement 2 was long. But I enjoyed it.

As compared to my first placement, my classes were for the most part larger. The maths classes were streamed though, and so it was interesting to see the interplay between student attitude and class size in challenges of managing class behaviour between groups.

I had year 8 maths, year 9 maths extension, and year 10 maths essentials. While the year 8 classes weren't formally streamed into groups labelled 'essentials', 'core', or 'extension', I found out towards the end of the placement, when taking part of a staff meeting about organising next years student groupings, that even the year 7 and 8 classes were still organised by ability, based on past grades and NAPLAN. So while all classes were taught the same content (unlike year 9 and above, where the different streamed courses did cover slightly different content), classes could still be thought of 'essentials', 'core', and 'extension'. And that seemed to have an affect on the students. As I interacted with the students, and particularly towards the end of the term, as the students were getting fatigued, they seemed to view themselves as the 'dumb class', which certainly added to the challenge of managing behaviour. Managing the classroom was then one a large aspect of the placement. It was interesting to compare the classes I had. The year 8s were loud, but got little work done. The year 9s were also loud, but got a lot of work done. The year 10s were much more subdued, and while I think the 'essentials' label didn't help their motivation, the class size (only 13) made it a lot easier to connect with individuals and make an impact on students. With the year 8s particularly, the setup of the classroom was important, as were the seating arrangements of the student. A seating plan had already been implemented, but with some new students in the class, some changes were necessary to help manage behaviour. Equally, routine and clear instructions were super important, prompting me to develop a consistent board layout, so classwork would always be in the same place, as well as some processes for starting classes smoothly. (APST 4.3)

The larger classes also meant there was a sizable range in ability across classes, which meant adequate differentiation was both more necessary, and more challenging, though I did manage some success in regards to that. A great activity that I was able to pull together fairly early in the placement was a game of bingo that got them practicing inverse operations, which was an activity I had come across in a workshop at the MASA conference earlier in the year. That was a success, engaging the entire class for the entire lesson. I was able to introduce some activities that I encountered on Twitter, including Which One Doesn't Belong, and Notice and Wonder, which worked well as well. (APST 7.4) An activity I created myself had to do with trying to use odd shapes to cover a fixed area, to try and find a solution that covered as much as possible, and then calculate the area of it. I had a few troubles getting students to do the area calculations part of it, partly due to the size and number of shapes involved, but the activity had promise, and was able to engage the entire class at different levels. (APST 1.5)

The thing I created that I'm the most proud of was a pair of 3D representations of a 3/4 cylinder:

My year 10s had been struggling to visualise the problem, so I made a digital 3D model to show on the whiteboard, but also a paper model that I could demonstrate removing a quarter from the cylinder and make some comparisons. The paper model particularly was well recieved! (APST 4.2)
