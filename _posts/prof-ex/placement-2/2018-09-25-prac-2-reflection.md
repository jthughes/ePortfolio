Placement 2 was long. But I enjoyed it.

As compared to my first placement, my classes were for the most part larger. The maths classes were streamed though, and so it was interesting to see the interplay between student attitude and class size in challenges of managing class behaviour between groups.

I had year 8 maths, year 9 maths extension, and year 10 maths essentials. While the year 8 classes weren't formally streamed into groups labelled 'essentials', 'core', or 'extension', I found out towards the end of the placement, when taking part of a staff meeting about organising next years student groupings, that even the year 7 and 8 classes were still organised by ability, based on past grades and NAPLAN. So while all classes were taught the same content (unlike year 9 and above, where the different streamed courses did cover slightly different content), classes could still be thought of 'essentials', 'core', and 'extension'. And that seemed to have an affect on the students. As I interacted with the students, and particularly towards the end of the term, as the students were getting fatigued, they seemed to view themselves as the 'dumb class', which certainly added to the challenge of managing behaviour. Managing the classroom was then one a large aspect of the placement. It was interesting to compare the classes I had. The year 8s were loud, but got little work done. The year 9s were also loud, but got a lot of work done. The year 10s were much more subdued, and while I think the 'essentials' label didn't help their motivation, the class size (only 13) made it a lot easier to connect with individuals and make an impact on students. With the year 8s particularly, the setup of the classroom was important, as were the seating arrangements of the student. A seating plan had already been implemented, but with some new students in the class, some changes were necessary to help manage behaviour. Equally, routine and clear instructions were super important, prompting me to develop a consistent board layout, so classwork would always be in the same place, as well as some processes for starting classes smoothly. (APST 4.3)

The larger classes also meant there was a sizable range in ability across classes, which meant adequate differentiation was both more necessary, and more challenging, though I did manage some success in regards to that. A great activity that I was able to pull together fairly early in the placement was a game of bingo that got them practicing inverse operations, which was an activity I had come across in a workshop at the MASA conference earlier in the year. That was a success, engaging the entire class for the entire lesson. I was able to introduce some activities that I encountered on Twitter, including Which One Doesn't Belong, and Notice and Wonder, which worked well as well. (APST 7.4) An activity I created myself had to do with trying to use odd shapes to cover a fixed area, to try and find a solution that covered as much as possible, and then calculate the area of it. I had a few troubles getting students to do the area calculations part of it, partly due to the size and number of shapes involved, but the activity had promise, and was able to engage the entire class at different levels. (APST 1.5)

The thing I created that I'm the most proud of was a pair of 3D representations of a 3/4 cylinder:

My year 10s had been struggling to visualise the problem, so I made a digital 3D model to show on the whiteboard, but also a paper model that I could demonstrate removing a quarter from the cylinder and make some comparisons. The paper model particularly was well recieved! (APST 4.2)

The other class I had was a group of year 7s once a week for maths enrichment activities. This was something that my mentor organised, knowing that I had a love of mathematical puzzles and curiousities. So first, he organised for me to visit the neighbouring school and observe their afterschool maths enrichment program. After I had observed a few of those classes, that's when he organised me to take another teacher's year 7 class. This was an interesting challenge as I didn't have a specific program or curriculum to follow, like I did with teaching the other classes, so I was free to do whatever activities I wished. So drawing from puzzles I had [previously collected](https://www.jeremyinstem.com/100factorial/), and from other things that [David Butler](https://twitter.com/DavidKButlerUoA) and Twitter had exposed me to, I assembled a sequence of activities that encouraged teamwork and creativity, to help show that maths encompasses more than just equations in a textbook, and to show that it can be highly collaborative, inspired by David Butler's [One Hundred Factorial puzzle session](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/mathslearning/play/). While it didn't always work exactly as I expected, some cool moments arose from it, and so I think it was successful overall.

Something that I didn't expect to feature so prominently while on placement was the professional learning that went on. I ended up getting 4 certificates of participation in professional development, and those didn't include the full day professional learning day, or some other sessions held during school hours. One of those was the MASA Quiz night, which I was able to help run, but there was another specific maths PD for using the Maths300 online resource, and then a session on cyber-saftey. (APST 6.2) What was neat about the PD day is I was able to contribute to one of the sessions - one of the other teachers was running a session on teaching using games - they'd taught an entire topic (negative numbers) only using games - and was sharing some of the things she had done with the other teachers, and I was able to help out with that session.

So what have I learned?

* I still need to refine my process for giving feedback, something I've been [looking into](https://twitter.com/JeremyInSTEM/status/1026063044994990080). 
* It's incredibly valuable to have planned and/or created any activities you might want to run before the start of term - sometimes you feel a lesson is just going to need an activity of some sort, but it can be really hard to be creative on demand. I suspect this may come easier as you build up a library of resources, but as I'm just starting out, I'm limited to anything I can source through my Twitter network, or that I can create with materials at hand. 
* I can appreciate the value of taking the time at the start of the year to try and set up class rules, procedures, and sort of build the class culture. If that's been well established, I can see the rest of the year being a lot easier in terms of behaviour management. Coming in for term 3, and already being on a tight schedule due to the class having to keep in time with other classes, meant that there was no true opportunity to establish those methods first, and while I could try and fit into the mould established by my mentor, it doesn't work quite right as you don't truly understand the reasons why, and don't quite manage to properly internalise their processes.

There may be other things, but I think I will need to mull them over first. So maybe I'll write a follow up post in the future. 

But now with my final placement over, work awaits...
