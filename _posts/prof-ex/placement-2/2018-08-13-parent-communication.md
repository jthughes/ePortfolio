Heading into a topic test with the year 8's has resulted in the necessity for communication with a number of parents. One student has been absent for the last week due to a broken arm - in response, I uploaded the relevant class materials to a OneNote page accessible to the student, and communicated this with the student's head of house so that communication could be made with parents to ensure the student was aware of, and able to access, those resources. 

In addition to this, there were a number of students that my mentor decided were worth emailing home concerns about their progress in class, in an effort to include the parents in the revision process to try and help ensure students were adequately preparing for the test. 

As part of this process, all communication with other staff, and with parents, was entered into the school database to keep record of what communication had occured with parents, and what had not.
