As I have continued to try different ways of running classes, different methods of differentiation became necessary. In this instance, it has been differentiation in manner of instruction. In response to students with different levels of knowledge and motivation, my lessons took on the following form. 

Capable and motivated students need little direct instruction. When given sufficient work, and given guidance on how to start, they often make significant progress unaided. By ensuring clear task setting and instruction at the beginning of the lesson, these students can be self sufficient, allowing the lesson to be tailored to the other students. The format for these students is to provided access to sufficient practice that remains on the whiteboard for the entire lesson, while picking out a subset of specific examples that students that work slowly can focus on. Then, to ensure all students progress through the content, the specific examples are periodically worked through on the board. Time is allowed for students to attempt the questions first, but working through them on the board means that students do not get hung up on any one question for too long. This also provides an opportunity for the least motivated students to copy down worked examples so at least some benefit is gained from the lesson.
