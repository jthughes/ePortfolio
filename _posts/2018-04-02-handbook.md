## Introduction
There is no one single way to teach that will work for every student every time. Thus a teacher needs a toolbox of strategies that can be used in their teaching. There are different theories on how to manage a classroom. These equally will not be as effective with some classes as with others. 

On the one hand, there's Rudolf Dreikur's Goal Centered Theory (or Democratic Discipline)[^1], which takes misbehaviour as stemming from an attempt to fulfil unmet needs, and so the teachers job becomes providing satisfaction for those needs through the manner in which they prepare and run their lessons. It suggests that "inappropriately gaining attention, exercising power, exacting revenge, and/or displaying inadequacy... lead them to group belonging[, and that] the need to belong is the primary cause of misbehaviour"[^2]. Teaching with this theory has a focus on student involvement in producing the positive classroom environment, providing encouragement, while trying to negotiate with, and guide misbehaving students back on task through understanding of the effects of their misbehaviour. William Glasser's Choice Theory[^3] has a similar focus on meeting student needs as a way of preventing student misbehaviour, and focusing on helping motivate students.

On the other hand are theories like Canter's Assertive Discipline[^4], or Alberto & Troutman's Applied behaviour analysis (ABA)[^5], which are more authoritarian in nature, and focus on managing behaviour more directly, with the teacher in charge of managing behaviour. Clear limits are set and must be met by students. Misbehaviour is dealt with by referring back to rules and logical consequences, using things like the ABC method[^6]. Particularly with ABA, there's a focus on Operant Conditioning[^7], using positive and negative reinforcement to encourage the desired behaviours, and consequences to reduce undesired behaviour. 

These different theories provide a useful approach for teachers to take, based on their own personal philosophy to target their actions, but knowledge of a variety allows the teacher to borrow techniques from each to assist in specific circumstances, or to adjust their teaching style based on the requirements of the class being taught. 
The structure of this handbook is based on the 3 general types of strategies: Preventative, Supportive, and Corrective.[^8]

## Preventative Actions
Preventative actions, or strategies, are those that are taken to try and prevent undesirable behaviour from occurring. These actions might not be visible to the students, or at least might not be obvious to them that they are intentional strategies. A core idea here is that of needs. Everyone has needs, and preventative strategies aim to satisfy those needs without students needing to express that need through misbehaviour or otherwise. 

There are some broad areas into which most preventative strategies fall:
* Conduct in the Classroom
* Lesson Planning

### Conduct in the Classroom
How the teacher presents themselves is important. Or rather, how a student perceives the teacher will affect the student's interactions with teacher and the course. It is desirable for this perception to be positive, and that perception is going be influenced in part by how the teacher interacts with the class (it may also be affected by interactions around the school, or from students or parents discussing their experiences with the teacher. When teaching at a school for the first time, this will not have developed yet, but going forward, if you become known for being a good teacher to have, new students may begin with a positive outlook on the class before the first lesson).

There is more to it than just the teachers awareness of how they conduct themselves however. The rules for classroom conduct need to be established, demonstrated and enforced by the teacher, and followed by the students. The manner and tone in which these rules are established at the start of the year will make a difference to the initial conduct of the class, and if done well can help the year stuff off on a positive note that can be built on from that point.

Dr Bill Rogers videos on his classroom roleplays[^9], and guide to settling a class[^10], provide some useful insights into how to start and settle a class, along with how do manage different challenging distractions. A summary of some of the principles from these videos is found in the Student Teacher Interaction in the Classroom lecture notes[^11]:

> **Bill Rogers: Teaching for teacher and student rights**
>
> * Aim for cooperation over compliance
> * Affirm behaviour you want
> * Clear rules and expectations
> * Supportive language, in a firm uncompromising tone
> * Have a range of corrective strategies
> * Consequences applied fairly
> * Speak to the behaviour, not the student

A key point to draw from the early roleplay videos is the importance of starting a class well. He demonstrates meeting a new class of students, meeting them outside the classroom, working to settle the class, giving clear instructions and setting some of the classroom rules immediately, like no mobile phones or chewing gum.

In the video "Bayley on Behaviour – Tough Love"[^12], the teacher David Torn does a similar thing. Taking on a challenging class, he also lines up all of the students outside the classroom first, establishing classroom rules immediately, and asserting authority over the class in a number of ways – standing in the doorway as the students file in one by one, correcting problems with uniform as they pass, before then establishing a specific seating plan, ushering individual students to their seats. 

**Strategies:**

* Be enthusiastic[^13] 
  - Never indicate that content is boring, verbally or otherwise, as students will disengage and demotivate.
  - Find a way to present "boring" content in interesting manner. The teachers enthusiasm may be infectious and motivate students.
* Be caring
  - Demonstrate care for the students, both about their studies, and their general wellbeing.
* Presence
  - Present yourself as in control
    + Strike a confident pose – feet planted and standing straight
    + Be conscious of your hands – wringing hands, fiddling with something, hands in pocket won't necessarily support the confident image
    + Speak clearly, and be wary of verbal ticks.
* Example: ending everything with "Okay?" can come across as uncertain/pleading as seen in Teaching with Bayley – Too much talking[^14]
  - Be conscious of your motion in the classroom
    + Moving about causes the class to track your motion and can prompt inattentive students to refocus if significant. 
      * Warning: Done frequently and unnecessarily it can be a distraction for more kinaesthetic students.[^15]
* Establish and enforce clear and reasonable rules
  - Having clear and reasonable rules removes any unambiguity about what is or is not acceptable behaviour
  - ­Rules are best given as a short list of specific, positive actions, explaining what to do, not what to not do.
  - For a more diplomatic teaching style, involve students in planning classroom rules at the start of the year, so that infractions are breaking their own rules, and they understand that all rules are reasonable.
* Routines
  - Clear routines for how classes start, run, and end, will help the class to run smoothly without students needing to ask for instructions on when and how to do things.
* Make the room a visually appealing space
  - Interesting, vibrant, welcoming, without being distracting. 

### Lesson Planning
Lesson planning is likely the most significant part of promoting a positive learning environment. What the teacher spends most of their time doing when interacting with students is teaching lessons, and it is here that the most work can be done to engage students to learn in a manner that motivates them to want to learn.

Gardner's Multiple Intelligences[^16] suggests that people are intelligent more ways than just being good at mathematics, suggest types like:
* Musical
* Spatial
* Linguistic
* Logical-Mathematical
* Bodily-kinaesthetic
* Interpersonal
* Intrapersonal
* Naturalist

Each intelligence is going to lend itself to a slightly different style of learning. By targeting multiple intelligences for a given lesson provides more avenues for student success, thus fulling a need, and keeping students motivated and engaged in their learning. Multiple intelligences could be targeted in the following way:
- Verbal descriptions and analogies (Linguist)
- Written examples, applicable rules (logical-mathematical)
- Visual aids (Spatial)
- Manipulatable objects, or interactive demonstrations/activities (bodily-kinaesthetic)
- Group work and discussions (Interpersonal)

Incorporating all of those aspects into a lesson might be challenging without some planning and preparation, but if the time is put in, none of those are particularly hard to incorporate into a lesson.

Another theory that can be incorporated into the lesson planning process is Bloom's Taxonomy[^17]. Bloom's taxonomy describes different layers of thought that students can be operating at with their learning. By making use of this hierarchy, it allows the teacher to consciously target activities and assessment at a range of different levels, providing opportunity for success for students at all levels, while encouraging all students to achieve higher levels of thought, which should allow students to become more capable and engaged learners.

Something that will be discussed later under the banner of Corrective Actions is that of providing support to specific students in developing skills to assist in self-regulating their behaviour. While adding support in developing certain skills for the students in response to their behaviour might be corrective, if the skill is generally useful to the whole class, by incorporating these elements to all other classes, it then becomes an ongoing preventative strategy.  

Strategies:
* Opening the class
  - Have a clear objective for the lesson and its relevance to the course, and communicate this to the students
  - Have a strong start to the lesson – settle the class first, get unrelated business sorted, before bringing everyone's attention to you and beginning the class smoothly
* Surprises 
  - Begin classes in an unexpected manner, or make use of creative activities that are non-standard 
* Outlines
  - Work out timings for different phases of the lesson
    + Identifies if a talking section is too long and needs to be broken up with activities, or delivered in a variety of ways (audio, visual, interactive, kinaesthetic
    + Identifies where transitions are
* Transitions
  - Plan transitions between tasks, so that they are smooth, not jarring and disruptive
  - Descriptions of tasks need to be clear and concise. Use short clipped sentences, and provide instructions in multiple ways.
    + Can gauge success by asking a student to repeat the instructions. If done with regularity, it will also encourage students to pay attention to instructions given in case they are chosen to repeat the instructions.
  - Make use of praise

> **Example - Teaching with Bayley (Praise & Preparation)[^18]**
>
> All instructions were written on the board before class, and everything was colour coded:
> * **Green** for keywords
> * **Black** for text to write in book
> * **Blue** for task instructions (not copied into book)
> * **Red** for anything else
> 
> Extension work was also written on the board, allowing students better able to selfregulate remain engaged for the full period while letting the teacher focus on helping students who struggle.

 > **Example - Teaching with Bayley (Praise & Preparation)[^19]**
 >
 > Examples of Praise used in the class:
 > * Sticker charts (for positive reinforcement at home, and for a goal to work towards (science trip))
 > * Praise for raising hand when required
 > * Name on the board with a tally for students doing good thing
 > * Welcoming the students at the start
 > * Involves the students in the praise
 > 
 > Praise is used to encourage good behaviour (use of the star chart to get rewards at milestones), reinforcement of good behaviour (praise for hand raising), as well as to help generate a culture of praise in the classroom by getting students involved in giving praise.
 
## Supportive Actions
Supportive actions have some amount of overlap with the types of strategies employed as preventative or corrective. A supportive strategy like using proximity to non-verbally encourage students to return to task can be used as a preventative measure by moving through the class even when all students have been remaining on task. The effect is the same - the teachers presence reminds the students that they are expect to be on task, but based on the timing either encourages students to remain on task, or return to being on task. Equally, strategies like I-messages (I-messages are discussed under Corrective Actions) can be used as a corrective strategy if the student has begun to actively misbehave.

Reading and responding when students become restive or agitated or otherwise deviate from the learning task.

Jacob Kounin's key behaviours of teachers[^20] summarise the goal of supportive actions – by being 'with-it', keeping aware of what all the students in class are doing, the teacher strives to manage behaviour by keeping the class focused, varying content if need be, and keeping the momentum of the class going, trying to make any supportive action to return student to task as unintrusive as possible, in a natural manner.

**Strategies:**
* Give praise to students exhibiting expected behaviour
  - Ignoring students who call out while praising students with hands up reinforces the expectation of putting a hand up to answer a question without directly addressing the misbehaviour
  - Encourages attention seeking students to behave in an acceptable manner to receive positive attention
* Be prepared to change the pace of classroom activities 
  - Allow a short break, or a reward for a period of solid work – quick class game or quiz for example
* Be flexible on how content is explained
  - Get feedback from students on the difficulty of content, and scaffold up or down based on students response 
* Physical proximity
  - Teacher's presence reminds students that they are expected to be on task
  - Using it for praise makes the praise more personal, and less embarrassing for those who dislike public attention[^21]
* Show interest in student work
  - Enquiry about the work, and praise on what's been successfully done acts as a motivator and a reminder to be on task
* Redirect the student
  - Ask them questions to involve them in the class
  - Get them to help run an errand
* Use suggestions, and hints
  - Have a signal that can be used to indicate to the class that, for example, there's too much talking – could be something like a bell, clicking, or a verbal warning about volume. 

## Corrective Actions
Corrective actions focus directly on responding to specific behaviour (remembering to focus on the behaviour, not the student). These strategies are for when there is a substantial violation of rules or disruption, and other strategies have been ineffective. The goal here is to quickly and effectively stop the misbehaviour and redirect the students involved on task, or else initiate a process for further discipline to happen at a later time. A lot of these strategies naturally fall into the realm of theories like Applied Discipline or ABA, particularly the later strategies, due to the focus on addressing behaviour directly.[^22]

Levin & Nolan[^23] have a useful chart that will be used to guide this section:  
![Hierarchy of Management Intervention](/media/HandbookHierarchy.png)


While the earlier less disruptive strategies are slightly more supportive in nature, they can equally be used as corrective. The chart provides a useful reference for tools to use as misbehaviour worsens.

**Strategies:**
__Level 1__
* See supportive strategies

__Level 2__
* Calling on Student – Lets the student (and class) know that the teacher is aware of students misbehaviour, and expects them to stop and refocus.
* "I Messages" – 3 part message: description of behaviour, description of effect on students/teacher, description of teachers feelings about effects. (Works best if students respect teacher)
* Direct Appeal – If teacher has established their authority, directly asks student to stop (with reason why).
* Positive Phrasing – tell them what positive thing will happen if they start behaving 
* "Are Not For's" – more a primary school technique, not recommended for secondary
* Reminder of Rules – Directs students to the classroom rules, and the associated logical negative consequences
* Glasser's Triplets – Three questions: What are you doing? Is it against the rules? What should you be doing? If answered dishonestly, correct student with the Triplets as statements.
* Explicit Redirection – Direct command to stop doing wrong thing and start doing right thing without room for student to manage their own behaviour
* Canter's Broken Record – Building of Explicit Redirection, if answered back, add "That's not the point", and repeat the command. Gives no room for argument. I
* "You Have a Choice" – after other methods fail, "You have a choice", obey the command and nothing bad will happen, or choose to accept the logical punishment for the disobedience. 

The final situation to consider is when there is continuing misbehaviour. Schools should have discipline procedures that students can be sent through, but outside of that it may be possible to talk to the student outside of the context of the classroom and negotiate a way to improve the misbehaviour with support from the teacher. An example of this is found in the Teaching with Bayley – Girl Talk video:[^24]

> **Example – Teaching with Bayley – Girl Talk**
> 
> **Problem:** A pair of girls are seeking social interaction with teacher, distracting each other and surrounding students, and calling the teachers attention from across the class, but aren't malicious about it, or poor students
> 
> Bayley’s suggested strategies:
> * Give them 3x60 seconds of full attention but warn about keeping them back after class/school if have to attend to them more than 6 times. 
> * Go cold when they go off task, focus on giving others attention, and only return the warmness when they return to task.
