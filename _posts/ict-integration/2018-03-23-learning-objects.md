*An introduction to Video Libraries, Learning Objects, and Gamification.*

Question 1: **Countries of the world challenge?**

What did you think of the countries of the world challenge? How did you go, how many times did you play, and did you get better after each attempt?

I recall having to learn all the countries in different parts of the world in geography and it being quite a boring exercise in memorisation. By making it timed, colourful, with feedback, a score, and a record of how many mistakes you made, it's very easy to track improvement, and encourages you to want to try one more time, to get a better score, particularly if you're also comparing with friends. I only played it a few times due to time constraints, but it did have that drive to try again, because the second attempt was better than the first, and you'd really like to see it say in red that "You made 0 mistakes."

Question 2: Learning objects?

—Choose one of the websites and identify one Learning Object and how you would use it in your classroom.

Looking through the suggested sites, one of the sites they linked to was the PhET Interactive Simulations done by the University of Colorado. They have a whole bunch of interactive simulations for subject across the sciences and maths fields, each with associated activity suggestions provided by teachers. A good example of a simulation I could see myself using would be one like this simulation of a [wave along a string](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/wave-on-a-string/latest/wave-on-a-string_en.html). While I'd still want to do some physical demonstrations in the classroom, the simulation would allow for further experimentation at their own speed, and outside of the context of the classroom, if necessary.

Question 3: Gamification?

—Gamification is not a new concept, the use of games to promote competition (whilst students learn by accident) has been used in education for many years. What games might you play in the classroom to promote learning by competition? (Does not have to be ICT)

Previously discussed examples of gamification included the various quiz platforms like [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/) or [Kahoot](https://kahoot.it/) which make the assessment of knowledge a fun competitive task, providing instant feedback to students upon making mistakes, informing them, while letting them have fun in trying to do better than their peers. My physics teacher at high school actually programmed a few games for us to play, that also demonstrated physics concepts, to give us a working knowledge of how different sorts of motions worked. An example of this sort of thing would be something like the game [Osmos](https://www.osmos-game.com/), which is built entirely on the idea of momentum - you have to expel mass in one direction to move in the opposite direction, and the larger you are, the slower you accelerate, and the harder it is to stop. For mathematics, I've been a fairly regular attendee of One Hundred Factorial, a mathematical games and puzzle club run by David Butler from the Maths Learning Centre. The puzzles that have come up are always interesting explorations into different aspects of maths, which could be used to engage students in interesting mathematics in a more fun way. Their [site](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/mathslearning/play/) has a bunch of interesting resources, including links to a bunch of different maths based games that could be used.
