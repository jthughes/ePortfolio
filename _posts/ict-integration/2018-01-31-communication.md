*Three questions have been posed:
1. Do we have a Digital Duty of Care?
2. Should we focus on Content Curation opposed to Content Creation?
3. Should the curriculum be confined to the walls of the classroom?*

I will first respond to the 3rd point, as I think it has a bearing on the first question.

No, I don' t believe that curriculum should necessarily be confined to the walls of the classroom. There is a time and place, where the resources at hand are sufficient to effectively learn while inside the classroom. However, research and investigation are also an important part of learning about a subject, and these are areas in which the ability to interact with people and spaces outside of the classroom can be incredibly valuable.

If we are then incorporating the powers of digital technology and the internet into running of the classroom, then we as teachers at the very least have a digital Duty of Care while students are online during school time, and making sure that experience is as safe as possible. The question may then be about how far does that extend, in the same way as it would in the physical world - does the teacher of have a duty of care off the school ground, and out of hours? I think we have a duty to ensure students understand how to keep themselves safe while online, as this is an important life skill as the world moves more and more things to the internet. I think that if we are in a situation where we see something of concern, or if we are notified digitally about an issue of concern, then yes we have a duty of care. I do think that, say in the case of social media, we shouldn't really be letting ourselves be connected to our students outside of the context of the school however, and that by being sensible of how we are connected to students, that might minimise dangers of potentially faces issues should a problem appear where you may have seen it, but didn't, and so didn't react.

To respond to question 2, I think it's important to foster creativity, and content creation is an important way to contribute to society. We definitely don't want to minimise content creation, and not train students how to do so. However, content curation is definitely a useful skill, made more useful by the volume of knowledge available at our fingertips. So I think that including more content curation is desirable, but not more than content creation.
