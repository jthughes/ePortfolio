Question 1: **Learning as its own reward?**

—*Give an example where you have been driven to learn to complete a task, challenge, game for your pleasure, that was not work related.*

Probably the biggest example of learning as its own reward for me is computer programming. Most of the programming I did through school years was because I had wanted to have a program that did something, and so I would try and learn how to use the relevant language to enable me to do that, whether it was learning how to use VBA in Excel to do my own sort of database application, or learning how to use html, css, and javascript to put together simple web pages.  Following on from that, while not coding, I also wanted to try run my own webserver, so learnt how to go through and set up a web server on a hosting service, including how to install free ssl certificates, and different pieces of software like multiple types of web forums, or wiki software, or using wordpress, to run things like my ePortfolio.

Question 2: **How will you record your marks?**

—*Electronic or Paper gradebook (Marks book): What would you prefer to use?*

Definitely electronic - it takes about the same amount of effort to input grades into an electronic system as it does to record them on a paper marks book. By recording marks directly onto an electronic system you gain a number of things. Firstly, it's easy make a copy of the marks if you need to give them to the school admin or something, if you're recording onto a local file. You also gain things like automated calculations, which can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be. By having the digital data, it makes it easier to use analytics to get further information from the recorded marks, particularly if you record how the marks were gained in fine detail. It also just saves space - you don't have to store a physical book somewhere, or worry about keeping it for a few years if that's required - it just resides somewhere on your computer or backed up in the cloud.

As far as exactly how I'd record marks, I'm not certain exactly - ultimately, it depends on what the school uses as far as collating student results, but I know that I personally like tracking things in relatively specific detail, so would likely set up a spreadsheet to track, calculate, and analyse student results, unless I find a software solution that makes that easier.

Question 3: **Give one piece of advice that you have learnt from this series?**

—*This is the last workshop in this series. What piece of advice have you taken away from this series? It could be something from the lectures, or from the work you have had to do, or from other student’s discussion board posts.*

Make yourself aware of the available technology, keep yourself up to date with what's out there for a range of different uses, but don't feel the need to use technology for everything. There's been some cool new technology across the podcasts, but as is the nature of technology, some things will improve, others will stagnate and disappear, while newer better thing rise to take their place. Being aware that these things exist lets you keep a look out for when these improvements happen, or new services appear. And while I think that all of the stuff that's been covered in this course is useful, and can make for useful tools, you never want to use a tool when it's not suited to the job. For example, technology is great until it stops working. You don't want to be so reliable on running everything with technology that you forget how to do stuff without it when it decides to not work. So use the tools that make things easier for you, but make sure you have a backup plan, and that the use of technology doesn't reach a point where it becomes detrimental to the student learning experience.
