*Introduction to LMS - a mixture of Administration (tracking information like student attendance, reports, student or parent details, etc.), a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) (a shared storage space, with course information and content, with student progress tracking), and a student Portal (a place to interact with students, link in a classroom). Edmodo is a free, clean, easy to use LMS system that could be easily used in the classroom.*

I could see myself using [Edmodo](https://www.edmodo.com/) to post lesson notes to keep record of what content was covered in each class in a place where students could see it – if ideas, examples, or additional notes about a new topic in Physics are getting added to the whiteboard based on student participation, you could take a photo of the board and upload it – that way, if students didn’t get to note something down, or were absent from the class that day, they have the ability to catch up in their own time before the next class. Then all the class content can appear along side the various homework tasks and assignments that would come up over the course, and so the students would be able to access any information relating to the course in one spot.

I’d also want to try and integrate Edmodo with [OneNote Class Notebook](https://www.onenote.com/classnotebook). It appears that you can connect the two together, and have assignments and marks from OneNote be uploaded directly to Edmodo, and have Edmodo directly link to content in OneNote. OneNote Class Notebooks seems to act a bit like the Portal and VLE = parts of an LMS, with individual notebooks for students to do all their work in, which gets automatically synced online, so that student work isn’t lost, and the teacher can always see their progress and mark it, and have these directly added to the Edmodo system, among other things.

I think if I were using them together, I would use OneNote to store all my lesson plans, notes, and assignment sheets. I would set and mark assignments from within OneNote and have them automatically appear on Edmodo, but I would then use Edmodo for *new* content – things generated in class, or announcements, or other context dependant things, keeping OneNote as a workspace and a place to store files and notes.
