<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">An activity about area for my year 8s tomorrow. Given a set of shapes, cover the largest area possible of a 10cmx10cm square without going over the borders. After finding a visual arrangement, they&#39;ll need to measure and calculate the actual area. Hopefully it works... <a href="https://t.co/3IBu6zxjvy">pic.twitter.com/3IBu6zxjvy</a></p>&mdash; Jeremy Hughes (@JeremyInSTEM) <a href="https://twitter.com/JeremyInSTEM/status/1032642355428356096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2018</a></blockquote>

This activity allowed students to use their knowledge of calculating areas to try and find a best solution to the posed problem, and allow for opportunities of new insight into finding areas.
