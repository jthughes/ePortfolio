* As students struggled with 2d representations of some 3D shapes, when calculating surface areas, I created two types of interactable 3D objects for them to explore. One was a [set of 3D models embeded in a PowerPoint]({% link _evidence/prac/3d-objects.pptx %}) (requires latest version of PowerPoint), and some [[paper models]({% link _evidence/prac/physical-3d.jpg %}) to demonstrate the process of the different stages of finding the surface area of three quarters of a cylinder.
