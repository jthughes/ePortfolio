Having access to professionals outside of the colleagues provides opportunity for new ideas, or access to new learning experiences, that could be used to benefit students and staff in the school. 

One way in which I participate with other professionals is through Twitter. I [follow](https://twitter.com/JeremyInSTEM/following) and am [followed by](https://twitter.com/followers) educators from around Australia, and around the world. This has provided opportunity to discover new resources, professional readings, professional development, along with exposure to different ideas about how to teach, and the opportunity to reflect on my own practice.

I have also been able to contribute to this network of professionals. I contributed to a talk to [virtual maths teacher conference](https://www.jeremyinstem.com/mfvc/), I have [offered advice to other teachers](https://twitter.com/ashola24/status/1021335334401921024), and have [complied and shared resources](https://twitter.com/mic_epstein/status/1036510604851400704).
