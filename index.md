My name is Jeremy Hughes, and I am a STEM Educator.

# Personal Statement

## Professional Knowledge
I believe that students learn best when their classroom experience is positive and nurturing, and that there are many facets to developing a positive environment in a classroom. Every student learns in a different way and comes with different collections of existing knowledge. By understanding these differences, a teacher is best prepared to engage students in learning effectively. Even small things like delivering instructions and examples verbally, visually, and in writing, allow the teacher to cater for a range of students, with the bonus of reinforcing the message, and making connection with different forms of representations. Further, understanding the individual needs of students allows the teacher to be conscious of the challenges facing students, and work to meet the needs of their students in how they act, and how they run their classrooms.  

## Professional Practice
A major focus in my practice as a teacher is in delivering early actionable feedback to all students. Effective feedback supports students in understanding their current progress and enables them to develop their skills and understanding further. Hattie’s research identifies feedback as having a somewhat significant effect size, and features in the High Impact Teaching Strategies (HITS) that was drawn from that research. I use varied strategies to provide this feedback. I provide opportunities for self-assessment, and monitor progress and understanding through weekly check ins, and through use of questions that ask about ideas rather than answers (another of the HITS), or through use of technologies like surveys/quizzes, or OneNote Class Notebook, when available. This information allows me to identify focus areas for improvement in general and informs of students to ensure get support. 

## Professional Engagement
It is important for teachers to continue to be learners, and to continue to experience the struggle of new and complex problems and content, so that they don’t forget what it is like to be a student. Through these experiences, teachers can metacognise their own learning experiences to enhance their practice, and to model the learning experience to their students. Engaging with other professionals, the wider community, and the body of knowledge these have access to, enables teachers to continue to be learners.

I continue to learn by building a network of sharing and inspiring educators by attending conferences such as the MASA annual conference, and using the Twitter social media platform, where I can access a vast network of educators from around the world and build personal connections with these educators. This allows me to continue to be exposed to new ideas, and research – through this platform, I’ve been introduced to books that have provided valuable knowledge in reflecting on all aspects of my practice as a teacher. It is through these books and these educators that I’ve been inspired model learning for my students and provide opportunity for short term successes to build motivation that will lead to larger long-term success for my students.
