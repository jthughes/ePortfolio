My name is Jeremy Hughes, and I am a STEM Educator.

# Personal Statement

## Professional Knowledge
I believe that students learn best when their classroom experience is positive and nurturing, and that there are many facets to developing a positive environment in a classroom. Every student learns in a different way and comes with different collections of existing knowledge, and by understanding these differences, a teacher is best prepared to engage students in learning effectively. For this reason, I enable students to engage with content in a variety of methods, as not only does it provided a fuller understanding of the content, but also supports the diverse student body by allowing them to engage in the content in a way most comfortable to them. 

Linked with this is the importance of clear task setting so that students don’t feel confused and lost in the classroom, things at odds with a positive and nurturing classroom. This is achieved by delivering instructions in multiple ways simultaneously, providing verbal, visual, and written instructions, with written instructions presented in a consistent manner and in the same location to promote a sense of stability in the classroom.

I also believe that [learning should be playful](https://www.jeremyinstem.com/mfvc/) – it should prompt you to enquire, to experiment, to explore. By making learning playful, we can support students to become capable critical and creative thinkers.  In my Mathematics classroom, I make use of activities like [Notice and Wonder](https://www.nctm.org/mathforum/), or [Which One Doesn’t Belong](http://wodb.ca/), which prompt students to think creatively, and discover and discuss connections in a safe, low-risk environment.


## Professional Practice
A major focus in my practice as a teacher is in delivering early actionable feedback to all students. Effective feedback supports students in understanding their current progress and enables them to develop their skills and understanding further. Hattie’s research identifies feedback as having a relatively significant effect size, and features in the High Impact Teaching Strategies (HITS) that was drawn from that research. I provide students the opportunity to self-assess, using tools like a rating of completed work of whether: they completed the work, understand the work, or could explain it to a friend, which helps me to identify areas that students need support and feedback on. I also make use of regular assessment, whether quick quiz questions (sometimes using ICT) or practice tests, which provide opportunities for specific feedback to students. Use of open questions, and prompting students to share their thinking, helps to provide me feedback on how students are going in an informal manner.

## Professional Engagement
It is important for teachers to continue to be learners, and to continue to experience the struggle of new and complex problems and content, so that they don’t forget what it is like to be a student. Through these experiences, teachers can metacognise their own learning experiences to enhance their practice, and to model the learning experience to their students. Engaging with other professionals, the wider community, and the body of knowledge these have access to, enables teachers to continue to be learners. 

I continue to learn by building a network of sharing and inspiring educators by attending conferences such as the MASA annual conference, and using the Twitter social media platform, where I can access a vast network of educators from around the world and build personal connections with these educators. This has exposed me to further research and professional learning opportunities, through workshops or readings, that I have been able to reflect on and share with the community. Through this network, I have been inspired to model learning for my students and provide opportunity for short term successes to build motivation that will lead to larger long-term success for my students. 

As it is not just about what you can get from a community, but what value you can add, I have also been able to make valuable contributions, through [presenting in a virtual conference](https://www.jeremyinstem.com/mfvc/), [offering advice to other educators](https://twitter.com/ashola24/status/1021335334401921024), or [sharing resources that I have compiled or created](https://www.jeremyinstem.com/100factorial/).
