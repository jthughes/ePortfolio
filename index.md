My name is Jeremy Hughes, and I am a STEM Educator.

# Personal Statement

## Professional Knowledge
I believe that students learn best when being in the classroom is a positive experience, and that there are many facets to developing a positive environment in a classroom. Every student learns in a different way, and so by understanding Gardner’s Multiple Intelligence theory, I make use multiple methods of delivering content to support learners with strengths in the different intelligences.
  
I also seek to incorporate the [High Impact Teaching Strategies](http://www.education.vic.gov.au/documents/school/teachers/support/highimpactteachstrat.pdf) (HITS) into my teaching. Many go hand in hand with targeting multiple learning styles, like using explicit teaching, worked examples, collaborative learning, and multiple exposures. A specific example of how I make use of one of the HITS, Questioning, is through the use of the questions “What do you notice? What do you wonder?” as discussed by the [NCTM Math Forum](https://www.nctm.org/mathforum/). This can be done by giving students a visual aid that may demonstrate patterns, and allow them to identify patterns and hypothesise relationships individually and in groups, before using the subsequent discussion to introduce the new concept after the students have discovered it for themselves.

## Professional Practice
To build and support a positive classroom environment, I make use an understanding of effect size to guide the selection of new strategies for use of the classroom. 

## Professional Engagement
I believe it is important for teachers to communicate and collaborate with other teachers, professionals, and communities. To this end, I actively participate in an international community of STEM educators through the use of the Twitter social media platform. This community shares ideas, resources, encouragement, and support, from which I benefit from, and contribute too.

I also seek to improve my practice through more targeted professional learning and development experiences, such as attending the annual MASA conference for mathematics educators, networking with other teachers and organisations, and attending specific workshops to learn how to improve the quality of my own teaching.
