# Curriculum and Methodology
## Core
See [Seminar Task reflections]({{ site.url }}/category/core/).

## Physics
The Physics C&M course involved building a unit plan that included formative and summative assessment pieces, including tests, homework, a practical, and a Science as a Human Endeavour (SHE) task. All of these resources are collected together into the Unit Plan file. Additional resources produced include a topic concept map, teaching observations, and a synopsis of a research article.
* [Newton's Laws Unit Plan]()
* [Electric Fields Concept Map]()
* [Lesson Plan of Observed Class]()
* [Observation Reflections]()
* [Article Synopsis]()

## Mathematics
The Mathematics C&M course involved preparing a short instructional video, teaching a 5 mintue lesson, preparing a lesson plan and a unit plan (including assessment), and moderating a maths investigation and preparing a report for the moderation. 
* [Proportionality Video]() ([files]())
* [Radian Measure 5 Minute Lesson]()
* [Unit Circle Lesson Plan]()
* [Introduction to Differential Calculus Unit Plan]()
