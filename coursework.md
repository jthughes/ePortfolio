# Curriculum and Methodology
## Core
See [Seminar Task reflections]({% link _category/core.md %}).

## Physics
The Physics C&M course involved building a unit plan that included formative and summative assessment pieces, including tests, homework, a practical, and a Science as a Human Endeavour (SHE) task. All of these resources are collected together into the Unit Plan file. Additional resources produced include a topic concept map, teaching observations, and a synopsis of a research article.
* [Newton's Laws Unit Plan]()
* [Electric Fields Concept Map]()
* [Lesson Plan of Observed Class]()
* [Observation Reflections]()
* [Article Synopsis]()

## Mathematics
The Mathematics C&M course involved preparing a short instructional video, teaching a 5 mintue lesson, preparing a lesson plan and a unit plan (including assessment), and moderating a maths investigation and preparing a report for the moderation. 
* [Proportionality Video]() ([files]({% link _evidence/maths/vid-files.zip %}))
* [Radian Measure 5 Minute Lesson]({% link _evidence/maths/lesson-notes.zip %})
* [Unit Circle Lesson Plan]({% link _evidence/maths/lesson-plan.zip %})
* [Introduction to Differential Calculus Unit Plan]({% link _evidence/maths/unit-plan.zip %})
* [Moderation Report]({% link _evidence/maths/mod-report.pdf %})

# Student Teacher Interactions in the Classroom
STIC focused on understanding how to manage a classroom effectively. The products of the course involved a handbook containing strategies to run the classroom, and reflections on a series of classroom simulations.
* [Handbook on Promoting a Positive Learning Environment](/handbook/)
* [Classroom Simulation Reflections]()

# Professional Experience
While the course focused on practicum and registration readiness, one last item produce was a unit plan modified with indigenous Australian content.
* [Modified Unit plan with reflections]()
